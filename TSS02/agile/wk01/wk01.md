## Scrum Framework

Define and describe:
What is Agile Development
Scrum Roles
Scrum Activities (Overview)
Product Backlog
Sprints

---

## Agile, an Approach

- Agile Development has many meanings:
  - Extreme Programming
  - Feature Driven Development
  - Kanban
  - Scrum

---

- `Agile software development` refers to **software development methodologie**s centered round the idea of **iterative development**

- Requirements and solutions evolve through **collaboration** between self-organizing cross-functional teams

- `Scrum` and `Kanban` are two of the most widely used `Agile methodologies`

---

## Agile vs Waterfall

- `Agile`:

  - Is an **incremental** and **iterative** approach
  - Separates a project into `sprints`
  - **Requirements** are **reviewed often**, allows for **change**

- `Waterfall`:
  - Is a **linear** and **sequential** approach
  - Divides a project into **phases or releases**
  - Requirements are **prepared once**, **hard** to handle **change**

---

## Scrum

- `Scrum` is a framework based on:

  - **Values**
  - **Principles**
  - **Practices**

- Mostly used for **software** or **web** site development
- Agile (lots of change, you may not even know what the end production is at the start)
- For **high risk** project
- VP’s don’t like it so much necessarily, at least initially

---

### Scrum Roles

- The `Product Owner(PO)`

  - **Responsible** for **features** and **functionality** (requirements)
  - Communicates the **vision** of the product
  - Responsibly for the **overall success** of the product
  - Ensure the **most valuable work** is done first
  - **Manages** the `product backlog`
  - Works with **business stakeholders** to **compile** and **prioritize** `user stories`
  - **Extracts and documents** `user acceptance criteria` from the stakeholders
  - Attends the `sprint planning`, `sprint review` and `product backlog update meetings`
  - Answers or tracks down any **requirements questions** in real time

---

- The `ScrumMaster (SM)`
  - NOT a project manager
  - Coach
  - Help the team **resolve issues**
  - Remove **roadblocks** (let the development team work)
  - Scrum **process leader**
  - Protects the team
  - **Co-located with the team** in the team room
  - Does **not manage** the team **organizationally**
  - Facilitates all `scrum meetings`
  - Facilitates **removal** of **impediments**
  - Encourages team self-management
  - Works directly with `Product Manager` to **clarify requirements** when needed.

---

- `Development Team`

  - Diverse, cross-functional team
  - Design, **build** and test the product
  - **Small** team (5 to 9)
  - Collocated
  - Self forming
  - Self-manages and **make decisions collaboratively**
  - Collectively **responsible** for `sprint delivery`. (If one team member is slacking the whole team is accountable)
  - Constantly collaborating in the team room to **solve** problems and make progress
  - Has fun together

- `Self-Forming Teams`
  - A group of people working together in their own ways

---

- `Scrum Team` and the Business
  - The **entire** `Scrum Team` can interact with business **owners** and **stakeholders**, although typically it’s the `Product Owner` with the `ScrumMaster` coming in 2nd

---

### Scrum Framework

#### Product Backlog

- Start with **features**, which are `EPIC` in size
- `Product Owner (PO)` collaborates with stakeholders to **define** the `product backlog items`

- The `PO` force **ranks** the `product backlog`
  - High value items always to the top
  - This document is a **“living” document** (items can move up or down, added or deleted)
  - Items are **estimated**

---

- `PBIs`, `User Stories` & `Acceptance Criteria`

- A `product backlog item (PBI)` is a **single element of work** in the `product backlog`.

  - This can include **specifications**, new **feature requests**, **bugs**, or **change** requirements.
  - Simply put, a PBI is an **individual task** that needs to be taken care of to improve the project or fix an issue.
  - However, PBIs **aren’t** necessarily **completed in the order** that they get **added** to the backlog.

- `User Stories` puts the **end-user** and their **experience** front and center

  - `As a (user type) I want to (what they want to accomplish) so that I can (the result they want to achieve)`.

- Each `product backlog item` that is brought into the `sprint` should have a set of **conditions of satisfaction** (`item-specific acceptance criteria`), specified by the **product owner**. These `acceptance criteria` eventually will be verified in `acceptance tests` that the `product owner` will **confirm** to determine if the backlog item functions as desired.

---

#### Definition Of Done

- Three types of Definition of Done (DoD):
  - Definition of Done for a **feature**
  - Definition of Done for a **sprint**
  - Definition of Done for a **release**

---

#### Planning Meeting(s)

- Facilitated by the `ScrumMaster`
- Break each `user story` into a set of smaller `tasks (sticky notes)` with more accurate **time estimates**.
- Finalize **commitment**.
- Team volunteers for the tasks on the board . Any tasks that have not been volunteered for **must be assigned** out by the team
- Creates “**burndown chart**” in team room becomes the status **dashboard** for everyone.

---

#### Daily Standup

- Facilitated by the `ScrumMaster`
- Team Members stand and answer questions:
  - What did you **do** **since** the last standup?
  - What will you do **today**?
  - What is **blocking** you?
- Teams then work for the day in the team room together. Strong preference for co-location in the same room (not cubicles).

---

#### Sprint Review

- Facilitated by `ScrumMaster`
- Attended/supported by `Product Owner`
- Team demonstrates all **vertical slices**, stories, to the product owner for **approval**
- Failed **items** go back to the product **backlog**
- Items that come up in the **review** may go into the `product backlog`

---

#### Retrospective

- Facilitated by the `ScrumMaster`
- Silent **writing exercise**
- What worked **well**
- What did **not** work well
- Can **add items** to the backlog
- The objective is **selected improvement**

---

#### Timeboxing


- In Scrum, `timeboxing` is a critical **component** of all five events
- Timeboxing is allotting a **fixed**, maximum unit of **time for an activity**
- The goal of timeboxing is to define and limit the **amount of time dedicated to an activity.**
- Some benefits:
  - Forces us to **prioritize**
  - Helps us demonstrate relevant **progress**
  - Motivates **closure**
    - Helps avoid unnecessary **perfectionism**
  - **Improves** predictability
