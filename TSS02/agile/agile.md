## Differences Between Kanban and Scrum

| Kanban                                                                                      | Scrum                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Roles are **fluid**. Project manager optional.                                              | Roles are **predefined**. Scrum master required.                                     |
| Tasks are **shared by everyone**.                                                           | Tasks have **assigned owners**.                                                      |
| Timelines **evolve** on an as-**needed** basis.                                             | Timelines are **timeboxed** into **sprints**.                                        |
| Changes can be made mid-stream, allowing for iterations **before completion of a project**. | Changes can only be made upon **completion of a sprint**.                            |
| Productivity is measured by the **cycle time of the complete project**.                     | Productivity is measured by the number of **story points completed in each sprint**. |
