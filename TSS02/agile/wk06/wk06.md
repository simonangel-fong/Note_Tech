### Planning Poker

- `Planning poker` is a **collaborative estimation technique** used in Agile project management methodologies
- It is a way for Agile **teams** to collectively **estimate** the effort or complexity of individual user stories or tasks within a project

---

- goal
  - The primary **goal** of `planning poker` is to **facilitate open and unbiased discussions** among team members to arrive at a **shared understanding** of the work involved

---

- Process
  - **Preparation**:
    - The `product owner` or `Scrum master` prepares a list of `user stories` or **tasks** that need to be **estimated**.
    - Each `user story` represents a **specific feature** or **requirement** of the project.
  - **Team gathering**:
    - The Agile **team**, including developers, testers, and other relevant stakeholders, gathers for a planning poker session.
  - **Deck of cards**:
    - Each team member is given a set of planning poker cards.
    - These cards usually have **numerical values** representing the **relative effort** or **complexity** of a `user story`, such as 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, and a "?" card for uncertain or **unknown complexity**.
  - **Discussion**:
    - The facilitator, often the `Scrum master`, presents a `user story` to the team.
    - The team members then **discuss** the story and ask questions to **clarify** any ambiguities or **uncertainties**.
  - **Individual estimation**:
    - After the discussion, each team member **privately selects a card** from their deck that represents their **estimation** of the effort required to complete the user story.
    - The estimation is based on their understanding of the story's complexity, technical challenges, and any other relevant factors.
  - **Card reveal**:
    - Once everyone has made their selection, all team members **simultaneously reveal** their chosen cards.
  - **Discussion and consensus**:
    - If there is a significant **difference** in the estimates, the team engages in a **discussion** to understand the reasoning behind each estimate.
    - Team members **share** their **perspectives**, insights, and concerns about the user story.
    - This discussion helps to **align their understanding** and can lead to **adjustments** in the estimation.
  - **Re-estimation**:
    - After the discussion, the team members **repeat** the estimation process, starting from step 5.
    - This continues **until** the team **reaches a consensus** on the effort required for the user story.
  - **Recording and average**:
    - The final **agreed-upon estimation** for the user story is **recorded**, often in `story points`.
    - `Story points` are a unitless **measure** used in Agile to represent the **effort or complexity of work**.
    - The **average of all the estimations** provided by the team members is often taken as the final estimation for the user story.
  - **Repeat for other user stories**:
    - Steps 4 to 9 are repeated for each user story or task in the planning session.

### Leads to Collaboration

- Planning poker **encourages collaboration** and **engagement** among team members, helps **uncover potential risks** and dependencies, and promotes a **shared understanding** of the work.
- It is an effective technique for Agile teams to **estimate work efforts** in a participatory and **democratic manner**, fostering team **ownership** and **commitment** to the project.
