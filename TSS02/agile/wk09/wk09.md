## Sprint Retrospective

Understand and explain Sprint Retrospective:
Participants
Prework
Insights and Actions
Sprint Retrospective Issues

---

- Sprint Cycle
  - Planning meeting the first day
  - Sprint execution every day of the sprint
  - Stand up meeting every day
  - Demo on the last day (The Sprint Review)
  - **Retrospective**

---

- `Sprint Retrospective`
  - An important part of the `Sprint` process, but one that is **not always appreciated**
  - An **inspect and adapt** enabler for the team’s Scrum process
  - Based on principles of `Continuous Improvement`, a foundational element to quality
  - Agile projects have many **unknowns**, the `Retrospective` is the opportunity to **perform course corrections** along the way

---

#### Participants

- The entire team should participate:
  - The **ScrumMaster**
  - The Development **Team**
  - The `Product Owner`
- If there are issues with the team being “open” with the `PO` in attendance, the situation has to be resolved over time
- **Stakeholders** and **Managers** should **only attend if invited (one-off meetings)**

---

#### Prework

- The focus is on **how the steps** in the Sprint process **worked**
- **Ad hoc areas of focus** may be applicable, e.g. new **training** requirements
- The focus may suggest additional **participants**
- The choice of focus and participants drives:
  - The **selection** of reflective **team exercises**
  - **Objective data** to be gathered
  - How the retrospective meetings and activities should be run

---

#### Retrospective Activities

- Big picture questions are:
  - What **worked well** that we should **keep doing**?
  - What **didn’t work well** that we should **stop**?
  - What should we **improve** or start doing?
- An open process without retribution
  - Any team feedback process needs a **high level of trust** for **open communication**
  - Team members won’t participate if trust isn’t there
- The process involves **sharing differences of opinions**
- There is both **objective** and **subjective** information, both are valuable

---

#### Insights and Actions

- The team **analyzes** data and subjective information
- The intent is to **apply insights at a systems-level first** (the overall process)
- Answering the big picture questions will drive insight:
  - What worked well that we should keep doing?
  - What didn’t work well that we should stop?
  - What should we improve or start doing?
- There may be more insights and opportunities to **improve** then can be done
- **Specific improvement actions** are selected

---

#### Sprint Retrospective Issues

- If the team does not “**follow through” with actions** coming out of the Retrospective, the Retrospective will become low or of no value
- An **open and trusting environment** is required
- `Continuous Improvement` usually yields dramatic results **over time**, rather than via a **one-time event**
- Feedback can be **emotional**, or **discouraging**, or a **complaint** session

## Review

- Who is responsible for the `Product Backlog`?
  - The `Product Owner`
- This Scrum Role **adds the estimates** for the `PBIs`
  - The Development **Team**
- What are the **inputs** and **outputs** of the `Sprint Planning meeting`?
  - The input is the `Product Backlog`
  - The outputs are `Sprint Goal` and `Sprint Backlog`
- **Estimation** is essential for
  - **Reducing Risk**
  - Better **Decision making**
  - Create **scope**, **budget** and **schedule** to baseline it against
- What are the **3 variables** of each `PBI`?
  - Estimate, Scope, Importance
- How are Timeboxing and WIP related?
  - `Timeboxing` is a **technique** for **limiting the amount** of `WIP (work in process)`.
  - `WIP` represents an inventory of work that is started but **not yet finished.**
  - Failing to properly manage it can have serious **economic consequences**.
    - Because the team will plan to work on only those items that it believes it can start and finish within the sprint, `timeboxing` **establishes** a `WIP` **limit** each sprint.
- What is `Sprint Velocity`?
  - The amount of work that it **can accomplish in a typical sprint**
- How do we know if the stories that we have written are good stories?

  - `INVEST`
  - Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimatable, Small (sized appropriately), and Testable
  - INDEPENDENT
    - Reduced **dependencies**
  - Negotiable
    - Describes the functionality, can be **negotiated** between the Team and PO
  - VALUABLE
    - Provides **value to the customer**
  - ESTIMABLE
    - Too big or too vague = not estimable
  - SMALL
    - Can be done is a **Sprint** by the team
  - TESTABLE
    - Good acceptance criteria

- Who do `User Stories` need to be valuable to?
  - Stories need to be valuable to a **customer, user, or both**
- Grooming the `Product Backlog`

  - Grooming refers to a set of three principal **activities**:
    - **creating and refining** (adding details to) PBIs,
    - **estimating** PBIs,
    - and **prioritizing** PBIs.

- Acceptance Criteria
  - Well-written `acceptance criteria` helps **avoid unexpected results in the end** of a development stage and **ensure** that all stakeholders and users are **satisfied** with what they get.
  - define **boundaries**, making the **feature scope** more detailed
  - reach **consensus**, setting **communication**
  - serve as a **basis for tests**
  - allow for **accurate planning** and **estimation**
