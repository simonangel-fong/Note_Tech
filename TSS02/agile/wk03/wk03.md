## Scrum Framework - User Stories

Explain the term `INVEST` in relation to good user stories
Understand **Agile Estimating** including applying `Planning Poker`

- used in Agile project management to help teams accurately predict the amount of work needed to complete a user story, feature, or other pieces of work.

---

- Are simple, clear, brief **descriptions of functionality** that will be **valuable** to either a user or purchaser of a product
- Expressed in a form such as

  - `As a (user) I can (do) so that (value)`

- They help to **defer the details** till later
- Talk **problems** not solutions when talking stories
- They fit nicely and are frequently used as a `product backlog item (PBI)`, but PBI’s can also be: `features`, `functionality`, `requirements` or `use cases`

---

- `As a customer I can reserve a hotel room online so that I don’t have to dial and wait`

- `As a user I can cancel equipment reservations from my smartphone so I can avoid late cancellation fees`

---

- **Details** can be **added** via sub-stories
- `As a premium site member, I can cancel a reservation up to the last minute so that …`
- `As a non-premium member, I can cancel up to 24 hours in advance so that …`
- `As a site visitor, I am emailed a confirmation of any canceled reservations so that …`

---

### Each story or feature has three variables

- `Scope`
- `Importance`

  - Selection of `scope` and `importance` is done by the **PO**

- `Estimate of effort`
  - **Estimate** is done by the **team** doing the work …

---

### INVEST in Good User Stories

- Independent
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimable
- Small (sized appropriately)
- Testable

---

#### Estimating

- Sometimes a `best guess`
- Sometimes an `educated guess`
- Estimates can be **absolute** 4.56 units
- Estimates can be **relative**, “it’s probably **3 times** as big as the previous one”
- People are **better** at **relative** versus absolute

---

- Benefit
  - Reduce **risk**
  - Better **decision making**
  - Create a **scope**, **budget** and **schedule** to **baseline** against
  - Sponsor/customer wants to know **what** they will get, **when** and **how much** it costs
  - But can we really estimate this way … for all sorts of different project types?

---

- Estimating Time
  - `Analogous time estimating` (info from **past** projects)
  - `Parametric time estimating` (identify unit **costs** of a task)
  - `PERT` estimating, for example (O + 4M + P)/6
    - visual representation of a project's timeline
  - But humans are **optimistic…**.

---

- Estimating an Agile Project
  - `User Stories` are typically estimated in **“points”**, which is a **relative estimation**, not an absolute
  - A **simple Story** is used as a `benchmark`, say 10 points, and other Stories are **compared** to the benchmark
    - If the new Story is 4 times more difficult, it might be 40 points
    - Units such as time or $ are **not** used, it is a **relative** estimate
  - We use tools like `Planning Poker` for relative estimates, to collaborate to come up with better estimates

---

- Agile Estimation and Velocity

- `Velocity`
  - a term used to **approximate how fast** the team is **getting stories done**
  - We use the **history** of the **last three sprints** to determine the team’s `velocity`
  - This can tell us how many `features` we’ll probably **complete**, by **when** and indirectly how many **$**’s (we know the team cost)
  - Not extremely accurate but good enough

---

#### Sprint Backlogs = Different Estimates

- We shift from points and relative estimates, to **hours** and **absolute estimates**
- A `Sprint Backlog` breaks a `Product Backlog story (points)` into multiple **sub-tasks** (in hours) per story
- We are getting more accurate in our estimates, and making the estimates based on who we have available on the team for this particular Sprint

---

#### Sprint Backlogs = Refined Estimates

- The time estimate for tasks is typically done in **“ideal hours”**, which is time spent exclusively on the task, with **no interruptions**
- We consider how many **“ideal hours”** the team might have for the upcoming sprint
- Some teams use **“real hours”** for their estimating which already includes some **non-productive time**, we will use “ideal hours”
- This more accurate estimation approach is required for the team to commit to completing the Sprint Backlog

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Identify some ways to lay out Acceptance Criteria
- Describe why we use Acceptance Criteria
- Describe how Acceptance Criteria is used

---

- `Acceptance criteria`

  - the **conditions** that a **product must meet to be accepted** by a user, a customer, or other systems.
  - They are **unique** for each `user story` and **define** the `feature` behavior from the end-user’s perspective.

- Used to
  - define **boundaries**, making the **feature scope** more detailed
  - reach **consensus**, setting **communication**
  - serve as a **basis for tests**
  - allow for accurate **planning** and **estimation**

---

- benefit

  - An important aspect in regard to acceptance criteria is that they **have to be defined before the development team starts working** on a particular user story.
  - Otherwise, it's possible the **deliverables won’t meet the needs** and expectations of a client. It also helps to **properly set a client’s expectations** for a product.

  - Well-written acceptance criteria helps **avoid unexpected results** in the end of a development stage and ensure that all stakeholders and users are **satisfied** with what they get.

---

- relates to User Stories

  - We know we want to `INVEST` in good `User Stories`
  - We know the **purpose** of `user stories` is to **explain the roles of users** in a system, their **desired activities**, and what they **intend to accomplish** by successfully completing a user story
  - So how can we make **sure** that user stories are completed **correctly** and **comply** with a client’s demands? This is where acceptance criteria come into play.

---

### Who is writing Acceptance Criteria?

- Either a **client** or a **development team** writes `acceptance criteria`.
- As a rule, criteria are **written** by a `product owner` and are reviewed by a **member** of the development team to make sure that the criteria are clearly specified and that there are **no technical constraints or inconsistencies** from the development perspective.

---

### How to write Acceptance Criteria

- Most popular are `scenario-oriented` (in the form of **scenarios** that illustrate each criterion) and `rules-oriented` (in the form of a **list**)
- `Scenario-oriented` is popular with Agile teams since it helps with getting across requirements, envisaging various use cases, and further using scenarios for manual and automated acceptance tests

---

#### Scenario-oriented

- The common **template** for describing acceptance criteria using a `scenario-oriented` approach is the `Given/When/Then` format

- Given some **precondition**
- When I do some **action**
- Then I **expect** some result

---

- The GWT template:
  - `Scenario` - the **name** for the **behavior** that will be described
  - `Given` - the **beginning state** of the scenario
  - `When` - specific **action** that the user **makes**
  - `Then` - the **outcome** of the action in “When”
  - `And` - used to continue any of three previous statements

---

#### Rule-oriented

- The rule-oriented form entails that there is a **set of rules that describe the behavior of a system**.
- Based on these **rules**, you can **draw specific scenarios**.
- Usually, criteria composed using this form look like a simple **bullet list**.
