## User Stories: Acceptance Criteria

Identify some ways to lay out Acceptance Criteria
Describe why we use Acceptance Criteria
Describe how Acceptance Criteria is used

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- `Acceptance criteria` are the **conditions** that a product **must meet to be accepted by a user**, a customer, or other systems.
- They are **unique** for **each** `user story` and define the **feature behavior** from the **end-user’s perspective**.

---

### Why we use Acceptance Criteria

- Well-written `acceptance criteria` helps **avoid unexpected results** in the end of a development stage and **ensure** that all stakeholders and users are **satisfied** with what they get.

---

### How it relates to User Stories

- We know we want to `INVEST` in good `User Stories`
- We know the **purpose** of `user stories` is to **explain the roles of users** in a system, their **desired activities**, and what they intend to **accomplish** by successfully completing a user story
- So how can we **make sure** that `user stories` are **completed correctly** and **comply with a client’s demands**?
  - This is where acceptance criteria come into play.

---

### What is Acceptance Criteria used for?

- define **boundaries**, making the **feature scope** more detailed
- reach **consensus**, setting **communication**
- serve as a **basis for tests**
- allow for accurate **planning** and **estimation**

---

### Who is writing Acceptance Criteria?

- Either a **client** or a **development team** writes acceptance criteria.
- As a rule, criteria are **written** by a `product owner` and are **reviewed** by a **member** of the **development team** to make sure that the criteria are clearly specified and that there are **no technical constraints or inconsistencies** from the development perspective.

---

### How to write Acceptance Criteria

- Most popular are **scenario-oriented** (in the form of **scenarios** that illustrate each **criterion**) and **rules-oriented** (in the form of a list)
- `Scenario-oriented` is **popular** with Agile teams since it helps with getting across **requirements**, envisaging various use cases, and further using scenarios for manual and automated **acceptance tests**

---

#### Scenario-oriented

- The common **template** for describing acceptance criteria using a scenario-oriented approach is the `Given/When/Then` format
  - **Given** some **precondition**
  - **When** I do some **action**
  - **Then** I expect some **result**

---

- GWT
- The GWT template:
  - `Scenario` - the **name** for the behavior that will be described
  - `Given` - the **beginning state** of the scenario
  - `When` - specific **action** that the user makes
  - `Then` - the **outcome** of the action in “When”
  - `And` - used to **continue** any of three previous statements

---

#### Rule-oriented

- The `rule-oriented` form entails that there is a **set of rules** that describe the **behavior of a system**. Based on these rules, you can **draw specific scenarios**.
- Usually, **criteria** composed using this form look like a simple **bullet list**.
