## Sprint Review

Understand the steps and issues of a Sprint Review including:
Identification of the Participants
Prework required
How to Demonstrate the Product (the work)
Sprint Review Issues

---

- Sprint Cycle
  - Planning meeting the first day
  - Sprint execution every day of the sprint
  - Stand up meeting every day
  - **Demo on the last day (The Sprint Review)**
  - **Retrospective**

---

### The Sprint Review (the demo)

- `Scrum` is an **iterative process**, an **inspect** and **adapt** process
- In order to **provide feedback**, **stakeholders** have to “see” what’s being built
- The `Sprint Review` is the opportunity for the team to “demo” what they’ve done **to capture feedback**

---

#### Participants

- Who should attend the Demo?
- The Scrum **team**
- Internal **stakeholders** such as users, **managers**, **executives**
- Other internal teams such as **parallel** Scrum teams, or **internal experts** on processes
- **External** stakeholders such as customers or partners
- Some demo’s can be open to **interested parties**

---

#### Prework

- Whom to invite? **Varies** per Sprint
- **Schedule** in advance
- Ensure the work that is “done”, is actually done, the `PO` should **verify** before any demo, that the work is done
- The `Scrummaster` will **manage the demo** as a meeting
- Who will be doing the **actual demo**
- Scheduled in advance, some participants may need **2 or 3 weeks notice** to attend

---

#### DoD and Acceptance Criteria

- Only **“done” work** should be “demo’d” to users
- Work should **meet** `Definition of Done(DoD)` requirements
  - `DoD` is a general **checklist** of all items being worked on in the Sprint
  - The team typically ensures the DoD is “done”, but the `PO` can check as well or may assume responsibility
- Specific work should meet it’s **specific** `Acceptance Criteria`
- `Acceptance Criteria` may include specific **tests**
  - The `PO` typically ensures the criteria is “done”
- Ensure the work that is “done”, is actually done, it has to work..!!

- Examples
  - The project is a web software application.
  - `Acceptance Criteria` for a user story for a specific web page.
  - The **criteria** might cover:
    - What the **layout** of the fields and static text on the page will be
    - The **order** of fields when the user presses the Tab key
    - The **graphics** on the page including size and positioning
  - `Definition of Done` (applicable to all web page stories)
    - The web page will **load** in under 2 seconds
    - Font **styles** and **sizes** will meet the standard for the app
    - The web page will have been tested for loading on 3 **browsers** x, y and z
    - Any foreseen **error messages** will have a help message

---

#### Demo Planning, Agenda

- Demo’s have to be **planned**
- Finished work is supposed to be **“shippable”**
- The agenda has to leave **time for discussion and feedback**
- The objective is to be **transparent** on what was done, and **not hide what wasn’t done**
- Software demo’s may require significant **set-up**, is there even the right **sample data** to show users software screens?
- Demo’s may require dry runs and **practice** (this would be an item required in the `Product Backlog`)

---

#### The Demo

- **Overview the Sprint** to the participants
- **Articulate what Stories** were in the Sprint
- **Demo** the Stories
- **Discuss** and capture feedback
- **Adapt**

---

- What if You Can’t “Demo” It?
  - Architecture **improvements**?
  - Only **completed** or “done” work should be shown at a demo, and most work has `acceptance criteria` or **tests**
  - Must be something that the customer can **“see”** or “use” that they view as having** value**

---

#### Revise the Product Backlog

- Based on feedback, items can be **added** to the `backlog`
- Based on feedback, some **items** **scheduled** for the next `Sprint`, may be **postponed** or **cancelled**
- The `Product owner` still determines the **priority**
- Even if feedback seems far “down the road” it can still be added to the backlog, but the `PO` may position it at the bottom of the list

---

#### Sprint Review Issues

- Participant attendance
  - Difficult to get **feedback** when the **right people aren’t there**
  - Not **enough time** is provide for participant feedback

---

- The **sign-off**
  - The `PO` determines if the work is **done** (before the demo), via the `DoD` and `acceptance criteria`
  - The demo objective is **not to get “sign-off” by the end users**
  - **User feedback** is the **objective**, which will result in changes and additions to the `Product Backlog` – and a better product
