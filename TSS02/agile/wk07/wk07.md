## Technical Debt

Define Technical Debt
How we track it in Scrum
Know why you need to be concerned with Technical Debt

---

- `Technical debt` (also known as `design debt` or `code debt`, but can be also related to other technical endeavors) is a concept in software development that **reflects the implied cost** of additional rework caused by **choosing an easy (limited) solution** now instead of using a **better approach** that would take longer.
  Source: Wikipedia

---

- `Technical debt` is often used as a **tool** for **“getting ahead.”**
- So technical debt is **any code added** now that will **take more work to fix** at a later time—typically with the purpose of achieving rapid gains

---

- Intentional and Unintentional

  - In 2007, Steve McConnell suggested that there are **2 types** of technical debt: **intentional** and **unintentional**.
  - According to MConnell, `intentional technical debt` is technical debt that one takes on **consciously as a strategic tool**.
  - As opposed to `unintentional debt`, which he calls “the **non-strategic result of doing a poor job**.”

---

### Where is comes from

- Bad **design**
- **Defects**
- Insufficient **test** coverage
- Excessive **manual testing**
- Poor **integration**
- Lack of **platform experience**

---

### Is it bad

- It’s not good or bad, it’s just **debt**.
- Most, if not all software products have **some degree** of `technical debt`.
- It’s whether you are **prepared to pay it back**.

---

### consequences of Technical Debt

- **Time** to **delivery** can increase
- Number of **defects** increases
- Product **deteriorates**
- **Predictability** will decrease
- Will lead to decreased expectations and decreased stakeholder **satisfaction**

---

### How to manage Technical Debt in Scrum

- Be **transparent**
- **Track** it
- Pay it down every **sprint**, so an entire sprint doesn’t end up being about repayment
- Add it to the `product backlog`
- **Adapt** your `definition of Done` (define code quality requirements)

---

## Sprint Planning & Execution

Recognize and understand Agile terms including:
Sprint Planning
Capacity
Selecting PBI’s
The Sprint Backlog
Daily Scrum
Burndown Charts
Taskboards

---

### The Sprint Cycle

- `Planning meeting` the first day
- `Sprint execution` every day of the sprint
- `Stand up meeting` every day
- **Demo** on the last day
- Retrospective 回顾

---

### Sprint Planning

- If you mess up the sprint planning meeting you have messed up the sprint
- One of the **objectives** in `sprint planning` is to **gather enough information** to be able to let the team work undisturbed for the duration of the sprint
- You can think of each sprint similar to a **mini-project**

---

- Plans are **guides** (not straitjackets)
- Plans in Agile have to **adapt (embrace change)**
- Agile planning is more about establishing a **target** or direction

---

#### Sprint Planning Meeting

- A Sprint **Goal**
- A list of team **members** (and team commitment on their time and energy – 100%, 50%, what is the team commitment?)
- A **Sprint Backlog**
- A **Sprint Review (demo) date**
- A **time** and **place** for the daily stand up meeting
- The `Product Owner` **must attend** this meeting

---

- How Much Should be in our Sprint Backlog?
  - The team creates more detailed **estimates** by **breaking** `User Stories` into **multiple tasks** per story with a time estimate per task, and asks **questions for clarification**
  - In some cases the **refined estimates** are significantly different than the `Product Backlog`, and not what the `PO` was anticipating – the PO may **re-scope**, **re-prioritize** and the team would **re-estimate**

---

#### Defining the Sprint Goal

- Written in **business terms**
- Anyone off the street would **understand** what the team is developing for the sprint
- Needs to **answer the question** “Why are we doing this sprint?”

---

- The team needs a **shared understanding** of what is to be completed in the sprint
- The team **commits to the goal**

---

#### Product Backlog

- `Product backlogs` will have `user stories` with **estimates typically in points** or `T-shirt` sizing
- The `backlog` is prioritized by the `Product Owner` with the **highest priorities** at the top of the list

---

| Product Backlog                                 | Sprint Backlog                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| User Stories                                    | Tasks                                           |
| in points                                       | in units of time                                |
| list of all stories or features for the project | highest priority items to be done in the sprint |

- sprint backlog can use time or points

---

### Sprint Velocity vs Capacity

- An **initial estimate** of how many stories can be performed in the upcoming Sprint is based on a **historical average** of points done in **3 previous** Sprints
- This average number of points done is called the “`Sprint Velocity`”
- This initial estimate is used for rough planning of the **next 3 or 4 sprints**, or for **how many sprints** would be required to perform for example, the top 50 Stories in the `Product Backlog`

---

### Selecting the Number of Stories for the Sprint

- While `Sprint Velocity` is **historical**, `Sprint Capacity` is **forward looking**.

  - It **varies** from one sprint to another, based on
    - **team member** upcoming **availability**,
    - **vacations**,
    - mandatory **meetings team members** have to attend not related to the project,
    - **number of work days** in the sprint,
    - **skill** sets,
    - and **other** factors.

- In order for a team to commit to the number of Stories for a specific upcoming Sprint, a **more detailed** analysis and estimation is required.

---

#### Sprint Backlogs = Different Estimates

- A `Sprint Backlog` breaks a `Product Backlog Story` into multiple **tasks per stor**y for greater granularity
- We are moving from **points and stories**, to **time and tasks**
- We are getting more **accurate** in our estimates, and making the estimates based on who we have available on the team for this particular Sprint
- This **more accurate estimate** is required for the team to commit to completing the `Sprint Backlog`

---

### Daily Scrum (Standup Meeting)

- Done in the morning starting on day two and **each day** afterwards
- An **inspect** and **adapt** meeting
- Yes – you stand up
- Always start at the **same time** in the **same place**
- Done in front of the **dashboard** (`Task Board`, `Burndown Chart`)

---

- Daily Scrum Preparation
  - `Sticky notes` (`tasks`) should be **up-to-date** regarding their location on the Task Board

---

#### Task Boards

- A graphical way to see **who’s doing what,** **how much** there is **to do** and how much to **be done**
- It’s a simple but powerful tool to share information and enhance collaboration

- It can be drawn on a piece of **paper**, a **white board**, a **wall**, or **“digitally”**

---

- Task Boards are **Used to Track Tasks**
- The team starts by setting up their Stories and Tasks in the first 2 columns
  - `story` | `to do`(task)
- The Tasks are in the “To Do” column
- Note the numbers on the tasks which **reflect hours of effort.**

---

- Team members **collectively decide** on **who** will work on what, note the initials on the tasks so we know who is working on a task
- One **objective** is to **not have too many tasks** “in process” -- **limit** `work in process/progress (WIP)`

---

- `Task Boards` provide the Data for the `Burndown Chart`

- Team members **move the task** over to the “Done” column when they have **finished** the task
- The `Scrum Master` tallies the hours of the tasks “Done” to **update** the `Burndown Chart`

---

- Daily Scrum – 3 Things
  - Just 3 things on the agenda for each team member:
    - 1. “What **have you completed** since the last standup?”
    - 2. “What **will you do today**?”
    - 3. “What is **blocking** you?”

---

- Lasts no longer than 15 minutes!
- That’s why you’re standing up.

---

- Daily Scrum Preparation
  - The `Task Board`, and the existing `Burndown Chart` are part of the **“Dashboard**
  - The **ScrumMaster** is responsible for the dashboard including updating the `Burndown Chart` **before** the `Daily Stand-up meeting`
  - The **entire team** must **attend**

---

#### Burndown Charts

- Chart that demonstrates **what’s left (task wise)** to do rather than what’s done, hence the progress line in the chart goes down, not up
- Graphical in nature, easy to see the **deviation** from the `initial Sprint plan`, and to **spot trends** early on in the Sprint
- The goal is to “burn down” **all of the “to do” items** by the end of the Sprint

---

### Potentially Shippable Product Increment

- Doesn’t mean it is shipped to customers. It is a **Business decision**.
- Is a high-quality output from the sprint
- Is the **value delivered to the customer** at the end of the `sprint`
- A point in time version of the final product
- **Reviewed with the customer** in the `Sprint Review meeting`
- `Potentially shippable` means the Development Team has **confidence** in the output
