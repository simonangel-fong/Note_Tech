## Prioritization Techniques Ordering PBIs

Identify some types of prioritization techniques used in Scrum
Describe these prioritizations
Know why we order

### Prioritization

- `Prioritization` is the Determination of the **order** and **separation of what must be done now**, from what needs to be done **later**
- Prioritization is not new to project management, it is also used in a **sequential (Waterfall) style** project

---

- Ordered not Prioritized
  - In the past, the Scrum Guide consistently used the word "priority" for the Product Backlog.
  - The `Product Backlog` must be ordered, ordering by priority is only one many techniques.
    - In the updated Scrum Guide it uses the **term** `Ordered` for the `Product Backlog`.

---

- Why order the Product Backlog

- **Ordering** helps the agile team to consider the bare **minimum features** necessary to **create customer value**
- We know that it is the `Product Owner` who is **accountable** for **prioritization**.
  - The `PO` is **not alone** in this activity.
  - For `backlog prioritization` to be a success, it must incorporate the **views**, **experience**, **vision** from stakeholders, the customers and users desires and needs, and the views and feedback of the Scrum team.

---

- Many Scrum experts refers to 4 headings to **consider** when ordering our Product Backlog
  - **Value** - business and customer value
  - **Risk** - tackling high risk items early can reduce uncertainty
  - **Dependencies** - a PBI that needs to **be completed before** our team, or another team, can start their work
  - **Releasability**- considering the **frequency and stability of releases**

### Prioritization Techniques

- `Product backlog ordering` is not an exact science
- What works for one company may not work for the next
- **Prioritization techniques** can help
- Let’s look at some techniques…

---

#### Stack Ranking

- When you stack rank, you consider each `backlog item` and place it **in order of priority**. You start with one, then two, then three, and continue to n, the total number of items in your backlog.
- A benefit is there can only be one number one, so not everything is high priority

---

#### Kano Model

- Under the Kano Model, features are **categorized according to needs and expectations** of customers
- Can think of it as **Customer Delight** vs. **Implementation Investment**
- It classifies items using five thresholds:
  - Must-be,
  - Attractive,
  - One-Dimensional,
  - Indifferent,
  - and Reverse

---

#### MoSCoW Method

- Must Have, Should Have, Could Have and Won’t Have
- `Must Have`: If you would have to cancel your release if you couldn’t include it, then it’s a Must Have.

---

#### Cost of Delay

- To **quantify** the `cost of delay` is to answer the question:
  - “What will be the cost per time unit **if we delayed delivery**?”
  - You can then compare your answer with the estimate to deliver the feature with the highest cost of delay, and is cheapest to do, first.
  - This is called `Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)` prioritization.

---

#### Relative Weighting

- The **value of a feature** and the **negative impact** that might be caused by the **absence of the feature**
- Based on the expert judgment made by the `product owner` and supported by the agile team in ranking the score of features (a scoreboard from 1 to 9 is usually used)
