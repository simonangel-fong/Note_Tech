## Scrum Roles

- The `Product Owner`:

  - Product Leadership
  - Responsible for **determining the features and functionality** of the final “Product”
  - Provides the **product leadership** role to the team

- The `ScrumMaster`:

  - NOT a project manager
  - Coach
    - Scrum **process leader**
    - Help the team **resolve issues**
    - Remove **roadblocks** (let the development team work)
    - **Protects** the team

- The `Development Team`
  - Diverse, cross-functional team
  - **Design, build and test** the product
  - Small team (5 to 9)
  - Collocated
  - Self forming
    - A group of people working together **in their own ways**

---

## Product Roadmap

- Once we have a `product backlog` we can define our `initial product roadmap`.
- This is a **high level strategic plan**
- Supports the product vision

---

- We focus each release on the `minimum releasable features (MRFs)`

  - MRFs are the **smallest “must-have” features**
  - WE can do more – but we must have the MRFs in the release

- Our product may have **many releases**

  - Q1 Release -Ver 1.0
  - Q2 Release -Ver 1.0.1

---

## Product Planning

- Each `Sprint` should have a `potentially shippable feature`

- Some organization do not release new features every Sprint. They combine **multiple Sprints** into **one** release

- Can release:

  - After each Sprint
  - After multiple Sprints
  - By Feature

- Whatever you choose to do the release planning looks at the **long term future state**
  - Customer driven

---

## Scaling Agile

- **More than one** Scrum team
- Coordination is required using a `Scrum of Scrums (SoS)`
- Used to coordinate **inter-team work**

---

### `Scrum of Scrums (SoS)`

- The SoS is not held everyday, but **every couple of days**.
  - This is decided by the `Scurmmaster`.

---

- Three Questions for the SoS

- 1. What **has the team done** since we last met that **could affect other teams**
- 2. What **will my team do** before we meet again that **could affect other teams**
- 3. What **problems is my team having** that it could **use help from other teams to resolve**

---

- Timeboxed to 15 minutes
- Solve problems after the SoS
- If your not needed, don’t attend..!!!

---

- **Large organizations** that implement Scrum can **still have project managers**
- The role of **coordination** of the **clusters of Scrum teams**

---
