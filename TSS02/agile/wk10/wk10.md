## Scrum Roles

- The `Product Owner`:

  - Product Leadership
  - Responsible for **determining the features and functionality** of the final “Product”
  - Provides the **product leadership** role to the team

- The `ScrumMaster`:

  - NOT a project manager
  - Coach
    - Help the team **resolve issues**
    - Remove **roadblocks** (let the development team work)
    - Scrum process leader

  - Small team (5 to 9)
  - Collocated
  - Self forming
    - A group of people working together in their own ways

## Product Roadmap

- Once we have a `product backlog` we can define our `initial product roadmap`.
- This is a **high level strategic plan**
- Supports the product vision

---

- We focus each release on the `minimum releasable features (MRFs)`

  - MRFs are the **smallest “must-have” features**
  - WE can do more – but we must have the MRFs in the release

- Our product may have **many releases**

  - Q1 Release -Ver 1.0
  - Q2 Release -Ver 1.0.1

---

## Product Planning

- Each `Sprint` should have a `potentially shippable feature`

- Some organization do not release new features every Sprint. They combine **multiple Sprints** into **one** release

- Whatever you choose to do the release planning looks at the **long term future state**
  - Customer driven
