## Web Scraping / Mining

- The process of **extracting data from websites** by **replicating human interaction** is known as `web scraping`.
- The process of **using bots to extract content and data from a website**.
  - Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, `web scraping` **extracts** underlying **HTML code** and, with it, data **stored in a database**.
  - The scraper can then **replicate** entire website content elsewhere.
- Using Power Automate Desktop, we can construct web scraping workflows **without the need for coding expertise**.
- The tool provides a variety of web scraping-specific **actions** and **connectors**, allowing us to interact with web elements and retrieve the desired information.

- Utilize the **pre-built actions** available in Power Automate Desktop to get started.

  - These actions enable operations such as **website navigation**, **form** completion, **button** pressing, and data **extraction**.

- HTML Websites -> web scraping -> data

---

- Other terms for `web scraping` include `“content scraping”` or “`data scraping`.”
  - Regardless of what it’s called, web scraping is an extremely useful tool for **online data gathering**.
  - Web scraping applications include market research, price comparisons, content monitoring, and more.
- But what exactly does web scraping “scrape” — and how is it possible? Is it even legal?
- Wouldn’t a website not want someone to come along and scrape their data?

---

### What can we scrape from the web?

- It’s possible to scrape all kinds of web data.
  - From search engines and RSS feeds to government information, most websites make their data publicly available to scrapers, crawlers, and other forms of automated data gathering.

---

- That **doesn’t** mean this **data** is always **available**.
- Depending on the website, you may need to employ a few tools and tricks to get exactly what you need — assuming the data is even accessible in the first place.
  - For example, many web scrapers **can’t extract** meaningful data from **visual content**.
- We can **save images**, and we can **convert** some images to data using `OCR`.

---

- In the simplest cases, `web scraping` can be done through a website’s **API** or `application programming interface`.
- When a website makes its API **available**, web developers can use it to **automatically extract data** and other useful information in a convenient format.
- It’s almost like the web host is providing you with your very own “pipeline” into their data.
- Remember Web APIs from last semester…?

---

- Many websites you want to scrape won’t have an API you can use.
- Plus, even websites that do have an API won’t always provide you with data in the right format.
- As a result, web scraping is only necessary when the web data you want isn’t available in the form(s) you need.
- Whether that means the **formats** you want aren’t available, or the website simply isn’t providing the **full scope of data**, web scraping makes it possible to get what you want.
- This raises an important question:
  - If certain web data is restricted, is it **legal** to scrape it?

---

### Is Web Scraping Legal?

- For some, the idea of web scraping can almost feel like **stealing**.
- After all, who are you to just “take” someone else’s data?
- Thankfully, **there’s nothing inherently illegal about web scraping**.
  - When a website publishes data, it’s usually **available to the public** and, as a result, free to scrape.
  - For example, since Amazon makes product prices available to the public, it’s perfectly legal to scrape price data.
  - Many popular **shopping apps** and **browser extensions** use web scraping for this exact purpose, so users know they’re getting the right price.

---

## Malicious Web Scraping?

- Not all web data is made for the public, meaning **not all web data is legal** to scrape.
- When it comes to **personal data** and **intellectual property**, web scraping can quickly turn into `malicious web scraping`, resulting in **penalties** such as a DMCA takedown notice.
- The `DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act)` is a **United States copyright** law focused on **digital mediums** that helps content owners **get their stolen content removed** in a fast and efficient manner.
- This extends to places such as `Internet Service Providers (ISP)`, web **hosting providers**, and **search engines**.

---

- A `DMCA takedown notice` applies to where the content is **physically hosted**.
  - So people **outside the US** can still file DMCA complaints.
  - For content hosted outside of the US, many hosting providers will still **honor** DMCA complaints, however, legally they are **not obliged to comply**.
- Canada has a version of the `DMCA Takedown`. It is called “`The Notice and Notice regime`” and it came into effect on January 2, 2015 as part of the `Copyright Modernization Act of Canada`.
- Its intent is to formalize the voluntary practice of **discouraging online copyright infringement**. It describes the Canadian process of how to **notify** a website owner and ISP of copyright infringement found online.
- This `Canadian Notice and Notice process` is very **different** than the USA's implemented version of the DMCA Takedown Notice.

---

summary:
- `Digital Millennium Copyright Act, DMCA`
  - `DMCA Tekedown`
  - personal information, and intellectual property.
  - ISP, website owner, search engines

- `The Notice and Notice Regime`
  - part of `Copyright Moderization Act of Canada`
  - `Canadian notice and notice process`
  - only copyright infringement.
  - website owner and ISP

---

- `Malicious web scraping` is web scraping **data** that the publisher **didn’t intend or consent to share**.
- Though this data is usually either **personal data** or **intellectual property**, malicious scraping can apply to anything that’s **not meant for the public**.
- This definition has a **gray area**.
  - While many types of personal data are protected by laws others aren’t.
    - But that doesn’t mean there aren’t situations where they aren’t legal to scrape.

---

- Example, let’s say a web host **“accidentally”** makes its user information available to the public.
  - That might include a complete list of names, emails, and other information that’s technically public but maybe not intended to be shared.
  - While it would also be **technically legal to scrape** this data, it’s probably **not the best idea**.
  - Just because data is public doesn’t necessarily mean that the web host has consented to it being scraped, even if its lack of oversight has made it public.

---

- This “gray area” has given web scraping a somewhat mixed reputation.
  - While web scraping is definitely **legal**, it can easily be used for **malicious** or **unethical** purposes.
- As a result, many web hosts **don’t appreciate** having their data scraped — regardless of whether it’s legal.

---

## Overscraping

- Another type of malicious web scraping is “`over-scraping`,” where scrapers **send too many requests** over a given period.
- Too many requests can put a **massive strain** on web hosts, who’d much rather spend server resources on actual people than scraping bots.
- As a general rule, use web scraping sparingly and only when you’re completely sure that the data is meant for public use.
- Remember, **just because data is publicly available doesn’t mean it’s legal or ethical to scrape it.**

---

## Uses for Web Scraping

- Web scraping serves many useful purposes in many industries.
- As of 2021, almost half of all web scraping is used to bolster ecommerce strategies.

---

- `Web scraping` has become the backbone of many **data-driven processes**, from tracking **brands** and providing up-to-date **price comparisons** to performing valuable market research.
  - Here are some of the most common:
    - **Market** Research
    - Lead Generation 潜在客户开发
    - **Price** Tracking
    - **News** and Content
    - **Brand** Monitoring
    - **Real Estate**

---

### Real Estate Scraping example

- If you’ve ever searched for an apartment or bought a house, you know how much there is to sort through.
- With thousands of listings scattered across multiple real estate websites, it can be hard to find exactly what you’re looking for.

---

- Since websites are structured in HTML, scrapers use regular expressions (regex), XPath, CSS selectors, and other locators to quickly find and extract certain content.
  - For example, you might give your web scraper a **regular expression** specifying a brand name or keyword.
- Basic steps:
  - Specify **URLs of websites** and pages you want to scrape
  - Make an **HTML request** to the URLs (i.e., “visit” the pages)
  - Use **locators** such as regular expressions to **extract** the desired information from the HTML
  - **Save** the data in a structured format (such as CSV or JSON)

---

- One of the biggest challenges of web scraping is **keeping** your scraper **updated** as **websites change layouts** (not everything remains Evergreen).
- While that’s not too hard if you’re only scraping a few websites at a time, scraping more can quickly become a **hassle**.

---

## Power Automate.

- Web applications are critical components of most organizations. `Power Automate for desktop` supports the automation of all major **browsers** through its `browser automation actions`.
- Microsoft **Edge**
- Microsoft Internet **Explorer**
- Google **Chrome**
- Mozilla **Firefox**
- **Built-in** automation browser

---

- `Browser automation actions` enable users to **interact** with **web applications** and components through UI elements.

---

### UI Elements

- `Web UI elements`, also called `Web elements`, describe uniquely the web components that the action is going to handle.
- All web-related UI elements are specified by one or more **CSS selectors** - **web selectors** - that pinpoint the hierarchical structure of the component on the page.
  - **Selectors** use the `>` notation to indicate that each element is contained within the element on its **left**.

---

- `User interface (UI)` elements are the parts we use to build apps or websites.
- They add **interactivity** to a user interface, providing touchpoints for the user as they navigate their way around; think **buttons**, **scrollbars**, **menu** items, and **checkboxes**.

---

- In `HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)`, a UI (User Interface) element refers to any component or object within a web page that allows users to interact with and manipulate content or perform actions.
- UI elements in HTML are created using various **HTML tags** and **attributes**.
- Some common tags:
  - `<button>`
  - `<input>`
  - `<img>`
  - `<form>`

---

- An `HTML tag` is a fundamental component used to **structure and format content** within a web page.
  - `HTML tags` are enclosed within `angle brackets` `< >` and are used to define elements within the document.
- Each HTML tag serves a specific **purpose** and **instructs** the web browser on **how to display** the content enclosed within it.
- HTML tags are composed of
  - an **opening tag**, the beginning of the element
  - **content**,
  - and a **closing tag**, the end of the element
- Some HTML tags, however, are self-closing and do **not require** a separate closing tag.

---

- The basic structure of an HTML tag:
  - `<opening-tag>Content</closing-tag>`
- HTML tags can also include **attributes**, which provide **additional information** about the element.
- **Attributes** appear within the **opening tag** and are used to configure the behavior or appearance of the element.
  - For instance, the `<img>` tag for inserting images in HTML can include the **src** attribute to specify the image source:
    - `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">`

---

- **HTML tags** form the **building blocks** of web pages, allowing developers to structure content and create interactive elements that users can interact with and browsers can render appropriately.
- The "**inspect" feature** provided by web browsers is a powerful tool used to inspect web pages.
- It allows you to view the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that makes up a web page **in real-time.**
- Right click anywhere on a webpage and select “Inspect” from the menu.
