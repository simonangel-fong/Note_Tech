## Management of Network Functions

- Network Functions
- Device Management
- File Management
- Network Management

---

## Overview

- Moving towards completely **decentralized systems**, more and more devices are linked through complex networks

  - Wireless
  - Teleconferencing equipment
  - Computers

- Tremendous demand on data communication networks by the number of hardware interconnections System administrators and users place increasing pressure on these networks to operate with greater reliability, security and speed

---

## Device Management

- In a `process-based DO/S`, requests move from the requestor to the **process scheduler**, to the **dispatcher**, and then to the **server**. Interrupt processing manages all device interfacing or processing problems.

---

### Process-based DO/S

- Systems have **clusters of resources**
- **Group control**
  - Configured around complex server processes
- Administrator process configured **as Device Manager**
- Includes software
  - Accepts local and remote service requests
  - Deciphers meaning, acts on them
- Server process
  - One or more device drivers, Device Manager, and network server component

---

### Object-based DO/S

- Each device managed **same way throughout network**
- **Physical** device considered an **object**
  - Surrounded by **software layer**
- **Physical** device manipulated by set of **operations**, mobilizing device to perform designated functions
- Objects assembled to **communicate** and **synchronize**

  - If local device manager cannot satisfy user request, request sent to another device manager

- Users
  - **No need to know** if centralized or distributed network resources
- Device Manager object at each site
  - Maintains current directory of device objects at all sites

---

## File Management

- Provide **transparent mechanisms**
  - Find, open, read, write, close, create, delete files
- **Subset** of **database managers**
  - Distributed database management implementation
    - Part of `LAN`
- Tasks
  - **Concurrency** control
  - Data **redundancy**
  - **Location transparency** and distributed directory
  - **Deadlock** resolution or recovery
  - Query processing

---

- Concurrency control
  - System ability to perform **concurrent reads and writes**
    - Provided actions do not jeopardize database
  - Provides serial execution view on database
- Data **redundancy**

  - Makes files **faster and easier to read**
  - Allows process to **read copy closest or easiest to access**
  - Read request split into several **different requests for larger file**
  - Advantage:
    - disaster recovery easy
  - Disadvantage:
    - keeping multiple copies of same file **up-to-date** at all times
    - Updates performed at all sites

- **Location transparency** and distributed directory
  - Users not concerned with physical location of files
    - Deal with network as a single system
  - Provided by mechanisms and directories
    - **Map** **logical** data items to **physical** locations
  - **Distributed** directory
    - Manages data locations transparency
    - Enhances **data recovery** for users
  - Contains
    - Definitions for stored **physical data** and **logical structure**
    - Policies and mechanisms **mapping** the two
    - **System-wide names** of all resources and addressing mechanisms for locating and accessing them

---

- **Deadlock** resolution or recovery
  - Critical issues in distributed systems
  - Most important function
    - Detect and **recover** from a circular wait
    - Complex and difficult to **detect**: involves multiple processes and multiple resources
  - Strategies used by distributed system
    - **Detection**, **prevention**, and **avoidance** recovery
  - **Recognize** circular waits
    - System uses directed resource graphs
    - Looks for cycles
  - **Prevent** circular waits
    - **Delays** transaction start until it has all resources
  - **Avoid** circular waits
    - **Allows** execution if transaction can run to completion
  - **Recovery**
    - System selects best victim, kills victim, and reallocates its resources to the waiting processes

---

- Query processing
  - Function of processing requests for information
  - Increases **effectiveness**
    - **Global query** execution sequences
    - **Local site** processing sequences
    - **Device** processing sequences
  - Ensures **consistency** of entire system’s **scheduling scheme**
    - Query processing strategy
    - Integral processing scheduling strategy part

---

## Network Management

- Provides **concurrent processes policies**
  - **Intrasite** and **intersite** communication
- Responsibilities
  - **Locate processes** in network
  - **Send** messages throughout network
  - **Track** media use
  - Reliably **transfer** data
  - Code and **decode** messages, retransmit errors
  - Perform **parity checking**, do cyclic redundancy checks, and establish redundant links
  - **Acknowledge** messages and replies if necessary

---

- Links **processes** (objects) together through **port**
  - When communication needed
- Provides **routing** functions
- Keeps network use **statistics**
  - Message scheduling, fault localizations, and rerouting
- Aids process time **synchronization**
  - **System-wide clock**

---

### Process-based DO/S

- **Interprocess communication** transparent to users
- Responsibilities
  - Allocating **ports** to **processes**
  - Identifying every process in network
  - **Controlling message flow**
  - Guaranteeing transmission and acceptance of messages without **errors**
- Interfacing mechanism for every process
- **Traffic operator**: accepts and interprets send and receive commands

---

### Object-based DO/S

- Easy **intermode** and **intramode** communications among cooperative objects
- **No need** to know **receiver location**
  - Only **receiver’s name**
- Provides message’s proper **routing** to receiver
- Process invokes operation part of its local object environment
- Services usually provided **at kernel level**

---

## Conclusion

- `NOS`
  - No full utilization of global resources available to all connected sites
- `DO/S` specifically addressed `NOS` failure
- Specific requirements
  - **Secure** from unauthorized access
    - Accessible to authorized users
  - **Monitor** available system resources
    - Communications links
  - Perform required **networking tasks**

## Windows Network Management

- Networking

  - Integral part of Windows operating system executive
  - Provides **services**: **user accounts** and **resource security**
  - Implements **communication** between computers
    - **Named pipes**: provide **high-level interface** for passing data between two processes (regardless of locations)
    - **Mailslots**: provide one-to-many and many-to-one communication mechanisms

- Active Directory
  - **Database** storing many information types
  - General-purpose directory service for **heterogeneous network**
  - Built entirely around `DNS` and `LDAP`
  - Groups machines into domains
    - Each domain gets a DNS domain name (e.g., pitt.edu)
    - Each domain must have at **least one domain controller**
    - Domain can have **more than one** domain controller
  - `Active Directory` clients use standard DNS and LDAP protocols: locate objects on the network

---

- `Active Directory` clients use standard `Domain Name Service(DNS)` protocols and `Lightweight Directory Access Protocols (LDAP)` to locate objects on the network.
