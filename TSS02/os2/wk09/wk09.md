### Role of the Operating System in Security

- **Key role**
  - Operating system level **vulnerability** opens entire system to attack
  - Operating system **complexity** and **power** increases
    - More vulnerable to attack
- System **administrator’s role**
  - Provide operating systems with all available **defenses against attack**

---

### System Survivability

---

### Levels of Protection

- **System administrator**
  - **Evaluate** each computer configuration intrusion **risk**
    - Depends on **connectivity level** given to system

---

- Configuration
  - Isolated single computer (without email or internet)
- Ease of Protection
  - High
- Relative Risk
  - Low
- Selected Vulnerabilities
  - Compromised passwords
  - Viruses

---

- Configuration
  - Local area network (closed, without Internet connectivity)
- Ease of Protection
  - Medium
- Relative Risk
  - Medium
- Selected Vulnerabilities
  - Sniffers
  - Spoofing
  - Compromised passwords
  - Viruses

---

- Configuration
  - Local area network (with Internet access)
- Ease of Protection
  - Low
- Relative Risk
  - High
- Selected Vulnerabilities
  - Email
  - Web servers
  - Sniffers
  - Spoofing
  - Compromised passwords
  - Viruses

---

### Backup and Recovery

- **Policies**
  - Essential for most computing systems
- **System manager**
  - Uses **layered backup schedule**
- **Backups**
  - One set stored **off-site**
    - Crucial for disaster recovery
- System management essential elements
  - **Written** policies and procedures
  - Regular **user training**
- **Written security procedures** recommendations
  - Frequent **password changes**
  - Reliable **backup** procedures
  - **Guidelines** for loading **new software**
  - Software license **compliance**
  - Network **safeguards**
  - Guidelines for **monitoring** network activity
  - **Terminal access** rules

---

### Security Breaches

- System security gaps: **malicious** or **otherwise**
- **Intrusions** classifications
  - Due to **uneducated users** and **unauthorized access** to system resources
  - Purposeful **disruption** of system **operation**
  - Purely **accidental**
    - Examples: hardware malfunctions, undetected errors in operating system or applications, natural disasters
- Any security breach severely **damages system credibility**

---

## Unintentional System Attacks

### Unintentional Data Modifications

- Security **breach** or data **modification**
  - **Not** resulting from **planned intrusion**
- Examples
  - Accidental incomplete modification of data
    - **Nonsynchronized processes** access data records
    - **Modify** some record fields
  - Errors due to **incorrect data values storage**
    - Field not large enough to hold numeric value stored

---

- When data is stored in **variable length fields** (top), all of the data is loaded into each field; but when data is stored in **fixed length fields** (bottom), critical data can be **truncated**, causing some data to be lost.

---

## Intentional System Attacks

- `Intentional System Attacks`

- Attack types
  - Intentional unauthorized access
    - `Denial of service` attacks, browsing, wiretapping, repeated trials, trap doors, trash collection
  - Viruses
  - Worms
  - Trojans
  - Blended threats

---

- `Denial of service (DoS)` attacks
  - Synchronized **attempts denying service** to authorized users causing computer to perform repeated unproductive task
- `Browsing`

  - **Unauthorized users gain access** to search through secondary storage directories or files for information they should **not have the privilege to read**

- `Wiretapping`

  - **Unauthorized** users **monitor** or modify **transmission**
  - `Passive wiretapping`: transmission **monitored**
    - Passive wiretapping reasons
      - Copy data while **bypassing authorization procedures**
      - Collect specific **information (password)**
  - `Active wiretapping`: **modifying** data
    - Methods include “between lines transmission” and “piggyback entry”

- `Repeated trials`
  - Enter system by **guessing authentic passwords**
- `Trap doors`
  - Unspecified and undocumented **system entry point**
  - Diagnostician or programmer install
  - System vulnerable to future intrusion
- `Trash collection (dumpster diving)`
  - Discarded materials (optical disks, flash drives, printouts) to enter system illegally

---

- `Viruses`
  - Small **programs altering** computer operations
  - **No** user **permission** to run
- Two criteria
  - Self-**executing** and self-**replicating**
- **Operating system specific** (usually)
- Spread using wide variety of applications
- Macro virus
  - Attaches itself to **template**
  - In turn: attaches to word processing documents

---

- `Worms`
  - **Memory-resident** programs
  - **Copies** itself from one system to next
    - No aid from infected program file
  - **Slower processing time** of real work
  - Especially **destructive on networks**
- `Adware` and `Spyware`
  - `Adware` infection: attempts to deliver **user-personalized advertising**
  - `Spyware` collects **private information**
- `Trojans`
  - **Destructive** programs
    - **Disguised as legitimate** or harmless program
  - Allows program creator s

---

- `Blended threats`
  - **Single program** including virus, worm, Trojan, spyware, and other malicious code
  - Characteristics
    - **Harm** affected system
    - **Spread** to other systems using **multiple** methods
    - **Attack** other systems from multiple points
    - **Propagate** without human intervention
    - **Exploit** vulnerabilities of target systems
  - Protection
    - Combination of defenses with regular patch management
- `Ransomware`
  - Software **prevents user access** to the device
  - Demands a monetary **payment** to restore access

---

## System Protection

- Threats arise from **outsiders** and **insiders**
- **Multifaceted** system protection
- Protection methods
  - Antivirus software, firewalls, restrictive access, and encryption

---

### Antivirus Software

- Combats viruses only
  - **Preventive**, **diagnostic**, or both
  - **Preventive** programs **calculate checksum** for each production program
  - **Diagnostic** software **compares file sizes and looks** for replicating instructions or **unusual** file activity
- **Removes infection** and leaves remainder intact
  - Sometimes
- **Cannot repair worms or Trojans**
  - Malicious code in entirety

---

### Firewalls

- Set of **hardware** and/or **software**
  - Designed to protect system
  - **Disguises IP address** from unauthorized users
- Sits **between Internet and network**
- Blocks curious inquiries and potentially dangerous intrusions
  - From outside system

---

- Typical firewall tasks
  - **Log** activities accessing Internet
  - Maintain **access control**
    - Based on senders’ or receivers’ **IP addresses**
    - Based on services **requested**
  - **Hide internal network** from unauthorized users
  - **Verify** virus protection **installed** and enforced
  - Perform **authentication**
    - Based on source of a request from the Internet

---

- Firewall mechanisms to perform tasks
  - **Packet filtering**
  - **Proxy servers**
- Packet filtering
  - Firewall **reviews header information**
    - Incoming and outgoing Internet packets
