## System Maintenance

### Evaluating an Operating System

- Knowledge required
  - Design goals and history
  - Users’ communication mechanisms
  - Resource management techniques
  - Trade-offs accepted to achieve goals
- Operating system strengths and weaknesses
  - Weighed against:
    - **Users**
    - **Hardware**
    - **Purpose**

---

- Cooperation Among Components
  - Performance **dependency**
    - One resource depends on other system resources
  - System **improvement**
    - Requires extensive needs analysis
    - System’s resources, requirements, managers, and users
  - System change **results**
    - Trade one problem for another
  - Consider **entire** system **performance**
    - Not just individual components

---

- Measuring System Performance
  - **Total** system performance
    - Efficiency with which computer system meets goals
  - System efficiency
    - Not easily measured
    - Affected by **three components**
      - **User** programs, **operating** system programs, and **hardware**
  - System performance
    - Very **subjective** and difficult to quantify
    - Not an absolute measure when quantifiable

---

### Measurement Tools

- System Performance Measures
  - Throughput
  - Capacity
  - Response time
  - Turnaround time
  - Resource utilization
  - Availability
  - Reliability

---

#### Throughput: composite measure

- Indicates system **productivity as a whole**
- Measured under **steady-state conditions**
  - Example: quantities
    - Number of jobs processed per day
    - Number of online transactions handled per hour
- **Measures work volume** handled by system unit

---

#### capacity

- `Throughput bottlenecks`
  - Resources reach **maximum throughput level** (`capacity`)
    - **Resources** saturated
    - Processes not passed along
    - Thrashing results
  - Main memory **over-committed**
    - Multiprogramming level reaches peak point
    - CPU processes jobs very slowly: very busy flipping pages
  - Bottleneck detection
    - **Monitor queues** at each resource

---

#### Response time

- Online interactive user
- **Interval** required to process user **request**
  - Time between user pressing key to **send** message and system indicating **receipt** of message

#### Turnaround time

- **Batch job** response time
- Time from job **submission** until **output** returned to user

---

- Online or batch context **dependencies**
  - Workload **handled** by system at time of request
  - **Type** of job or request being submitted
- Include
  - **Average** values and **variance**

---

#### Resource utilization

- How much unit contributing to overall operation
- **Percentage** of time resource actually in use
  - Example: CPU busy 60 percent of time?
- Helps analyst determine:
  - Balance among system units
  - System category: **I/O-bound** or **CPU-bound**

---

#### Availability

- Indicates **likelihood** resource **ready when needed**
- Influences

  - `Mean time between failures (MTBF)`
    - Average time unit operational before breaks down
  - `Mean time to repair (MTTR)`
    - Average time needed to fix failed unit and put back in service

- `A = MTBF / MTBF + MTTR`

---

#### Reliability

- Measures **probability** unit will **not fail** during given time period
- Function of MTBF

---

- Performance measures
  - Avoid taking in **isolation** from system workload
- Overall system performance
  - **Varies** with time
  - Important to define actual **working environment**
    - Before making generalizations

---

### Feedback Loops

- **Monitor** system resource utilization for adjustments
  - Information provided to `Job Scheduler`
    - Prevents processor time spent on overhead
    - More time executing jobs
- Feedback loop types
  - **Negative** feedback loop
  - **Positive** feedback loop

---

- `Negative feedback loop`
  - **Process arrival rate decreased** when system too congested
    - Stabilized system
    - Queue lengths close to estimated mean values
- `Positive feedback loop`
  - **Arrival rate increased** when system underutilized
    - Paged virtual memory systems use this
    - Implementation more difficult (than negative loops)
