## Types of Operating Systems

- Network Operating System
- Distributed Operating System

---

### Network Operating System

- `Network operating systems (NOS)`
  - First network operating systems
  - Give local operating systems **extended powers**
  - Handle interfacing details
    - Coordinate remote processing
  - Coordinate communications
    - Between local operating systems
  - Limitations
    - **No global control** of memory management, process management, device management, file management
    - **No true distributed computing**

---

- In a `NOS` environment, each **node**, shown here as a circle, is managed by its own **local operating system**, shown here as triangles.
  - Their respective **network operating systems**, shown here as squares, come into play **only when one site’s system needs to work with another site’s system.**

---

### Distributed operating systems (DO/S)

- **Global assets controlled** by operating system
- Provide **unified** environment
  - Optimize whole network operations
- Construction
  - **Replicated** kernel operating system
- Network and intricacies hidden from users
  - **Use network as single logical system**

---

- In a `DO/S` environment, **all nodes** are part of a **globally managed operating system** designed to **optimize all system resources**.
- Requests **between nodes** are **handled** entirely by the **DO/S** as well as every operation at every node.

---

### Comparison

| Network Operating System (NOS)                                                              | Distributed Operating System (DO/S)                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local resources** are owned by each **local node**.                                       | Resources are **owned** by a **global operating system**.                                         |
| Local resources are managed by the **local operating system**.                              | **Local** resources are managed by a **global** operating system.                                 |
| Access is allowed in accordance with the **policies** of each **local** operating system.   | Access is allowed in accordance with the **policy** of the **global operating system**.           |
| **Requests are passed** from one local operating system to another via each node's **NOS**. | **Requests** are passed from one node to another node directly via a **global** operating system. |

## DO/S Development

- `Distributed Operating System`
  - an **application** that executes a collection of protocols to **coordinate the actions of multiple processes** on a network, such that all components cooperate together to perform a single or small set of related tasks.
- Entire network resource groups **managed globally**
  - Negotiation- and compromise-based resource allocation
    - Occurs among equally important **peer sites**
- Advantage
  - **No special server software on local machines**

  - Ubuntu
  - Linux Apache Server
  - LOCUS

---

## Memory Management

- Uses kernel with **paging algorithm**
  - **Tracks** available memory amount
  - Based on goals of local system
  - Global system requirements drive local site policies and mechanisms
- Memory allocation and deallocation dependencies
  - Scheduling and resource-sharing schemes that optimize network resources

---

- Extended role
  - Memory requests: **local and global sources**
- Local level
  - **Page allocation** based on **local policy**
- Global level
  - Receives `process manager` memory requests for new or expanding client or server processes
  - Uses local resources for memory garbage collection, compaction
  - Decides most and least active processes
  - Determines preemptive processes to provide space

---

- Functions
