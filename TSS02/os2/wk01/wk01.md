## Computer Hardware Types

- `Hardware`: physical machine and electronic components
  - **Main memory** (`RAM`)
    - Data/Instruction storage and execution
  - **Central processing unit** (`CPU`)
    - Controls interpretation and execution of instructions
    - Initiates or performs these operations: storage, data manipulation and input/output
  - **Input/output devices** (I/O devices)
    - All peripheral devices in the system: printers, disk drives, CD/DVD drives, keyboards, etc.

| Platform              | Operating System                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Laptops, desktops     | Linux, Mac OS X, Unix, Windows        |
| Mainframe computers   | Linux, UNIX, Windows, IBM z/OS        |
| OSupercomputers       | Linux, UNIX                           |
| Telephones, tablets   | Android, iOS, Windows                 |
| Workstations, servers | Linux, Mac OS X Server, UNIX, Windows |

- `Mooreâ€™s Law`:
  - Gordon Moore, 1965
  - Each new processor chip compared to its predecessor
    - **Twice** as much capacity
    - Released within **18 to 24 months**

## Types of Operating Systems

- Two distinguishing features
  - **Response time**
  - **Method of data entry** into the system

---

- `Batch systems`:

  - jobs entered **as a whole** and in **sequence**
  - Input relied on punched cards or tape
  - Efficiency measured in **throughput**

- `Interactive systems`:

  - allow **multiple jobs**
  - **Faster turnaround** than batch systems
  - **Slower** than `real-time systems`
  - Introduced to provide fast turnaround when debugging programs
  - Complex **algorithms**: share processing power

- `Hybrid systems`

  - **Combination** of `batch` and `interactive`
  - Light interactive load - Accepts and runs batch programs in the background

- `Real-time systems`

  - **Reliability** is critical, Used in **time-critical** environments
  - Spacecraft, airport traffic control, fly-by-wire aircraft, critical industrial processes, medical systems, etc.
  - Two types of real-time systems
    - `Hard real-time systems`: risk total system **failure** if predicted **time deadline missed**
    - `Soft real-time systems`: suffer **performance degradation** as a consequence of a missed deadline

- `Network operating systems`

  - Special class of software
  - Users perform tasks using **few**, if any, local **resources**, e.g., `cloud computing`
  - **Wireless networking** capability
  - Standard feature in many computing devices: cell phones, tablets, and other handheld Web browsers

- `Embedded systems`
  - Computers placed **inside other products**
    - Automobiles, digital music players, elevators, pacemakers, etc.
  - Adds features and capabilities
  - Operating system requirements
    - Perform **specific set** of programs
    - **Non-interchangeable** among systems
    - **Small kernel** and flexible function capabilities
