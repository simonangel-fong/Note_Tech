## Network Organization Concepts

- `Network`
  - Collection of loosely **coupled processors**
  - Interconnected by **communication links**
    - Using **cables**, **wireless** technology, both
  - Common goal
    - Provide convenient **resource sharing**
    - **Control access**
  - General network configurations
    - `Network operating system (NOS)`
    - Distributed operating system

---

- `Network operating system (NOS)`
  - Networking capability
    - Added to single-user operating system
  - Users **aware of** specific computers and resources **in network**
    - Access resources
  - Log on to **remote host**
    - **Data transfer** from remote host

---

- `Distributed operating system`

  - Users **not aware** of specific computers and resources in network
    - Access remote resources as if local
  - Good control: distributed computing systems
    - Allows **unified resource access**
  - Total view across multiple computer systems
    - **No local dependencies** for controlling and managing resources
  - Cooperative management
  - Comprised of **four managers** with a wider scope

- Device Manager
- Processor manager
- Memory Manager
- File Manager
- Network Manger

---

`Remote`
**Other** processors and resources

- `Local`
  - Processor’s **own** resources
- `Site`
  - **Specific location** in network
  - One or more computers
- `Host`
  - Specific computer **system** **at site**
    - Services and resources used from remote locations
- `Node`

  - Name assigned to **computer system**
    - Provides identification

- `Clients` **request** data or services from the `host` server and wait for the response.
  - If the client host has resources needed by the server host, the roles can be reversed.

## Network Topologies

### Network Topologies

- **Physically** or **logically** connected sites
- Most common **geometric arrangements**: `star`, `ring`, `bus`, `tree`, `hybrid`
- Topology trade-offs
  - Need for **fast communication** among all sites
  - **Tolreance of failure** at a site or communication link
  - **Cost** of long communication lines
  - Difficulty connecting one site to **large number** of other sites

---

- Four basic criteria in design consideration
  - **Basic cost**
    - **Expense** required to link various sites in system
  - **Communications cost**
    - **Time required** to send message from one site to another
  - **Reliability**
    - **Assurance** of site communication if link or site **fails**
  - **User environment**
    - Critical parameters for successful business investment

---

### Star

- Transmitted data from `sender` to `receiver`
  - Passes through `central controller`
- `Hub` or `centralized topology`
- **Advantages**
  - Permits **easy routing**
  - Easy **access control** to network
- **Disadvantages**
  - Requires extremely **reliable central site**
  - Requires **ability to handle** all network traffic
    - No matter how heavy

---

- `Star topology`
  - Hosts are connected to each other **through** a `central controller`, which assumes all **responsibility for routing messages** to the appropriate host.
  - Data flow between the ho`sts and the `central controller` is represented by **dotted lines**.
  - Direct `host-to-host` communication **isn’t permitted**.

---

### Ring

- Sites connected **in closed loop**
- May **connect to other** networks
  - Using `bridge`: **same protocols**
  - Using `gateway`: **different protocols**
- Data transmitted in **packets**
  - **Source** and **destination** address fields
- Packet passed **from node to node**
  - **One direction** only
- Every node must be **functional**
  - **Bypass failed** node needed for proper operation

---

- `Ring topology`.

  - `Hosts` are connected to each other in a **circular fashion** with data flowing in **one direction only**, shown here as **dotted lines**.
  - The network can be connected to other networks via a `bridge` or `gateway`.

- A **double loop computer network** using a ring topology.
- Packets of data flow in **both directions**.

- **Multiple** `rings` **bridged** together.
  - Three rings connected to each other by two **bridges**.
  - This variation of ring topology allows several networks with the **same protocol** to be linked together.

---

### Bus

- Sites connect to **single communication line**
- Messages circulate in **both directions**
  - One site sends messages **at a time** successfully
- Need **control** mechanism
  - Prevent **collisions**
- Data **passes directly** from one device to another
- Data may be **routed** to `end point controller` at end of the line

---

- `Bus topology`.
  - `Hosts` are connected to one another **in a linear fashion**.
  - Data flows in **both directions** from host to host and is **turned around** when it reaches an `end point controller`.

---

### Tree

- Collection of **buses** connected by **branching cable**
- **No** closed **loops**
- Designers create networks using `bridges`
- Message from any site
  - **Received by all** other sites **until** reaching end point
- Message reaching `end point controller` without **acceptance**
  - End point controller **absorbs message**
- Advantage
  - Message traffic still **flows** even if **single node fails**

---

- `Tree topology`.
  - Data flows up and down the **branches** of the trees and is **absorbed** by `controllers` at the end points.
  - Gateways help **minimize differences** between the **protocol** used on one part of the network and the **different protocol** used on the branch with host 7.

---

### Hybrid

- Strong points of each topology in combination
- Effectively meet system communications requirements

- `Hybrid topology`, **version 1**.

  - This network combines a `star` and a `ring`, connected by a `bridge`.
  - Hosts 5, 6, 7, and 8 are located on the ring.

- `Hybrid topology`, **version 2**.
  - This network combines `star` and `bus` topologies.

---

## Network Types

- `Grouping`
  - According to physical distances covered
  - Characteristics are blurring
- Network types
  - Local area networks (LAN)
  - Metropolitan area networks (MAN)
  - Wide area networks (WAN)

---

### Personal Area Network (PAN)

- Information technology
  - Operating within 10 m radius
  - Centered around one person: `body area network (BAN)`
- Wearable technology
  - Gloves, caps, monitors, etc.
- May be connected to LAN

---

### Local Area Network

- Single office building, campus, similarly enclosed environment
  - Single organization owns/operates
- Communicate through **common** communication line
- Communications not limited to local area only
  - Component of larger communication network
  - Easy **access** to outside
    - Through **bridge** or **gateway**

---

- `Bridge`
  - Connects two or more **geographically distant** `LANs`
  - **Same protocols**
    - Example: connection of two LANs using Ethernet
- `Gateway`
  - Connects two or more LANs or systems
    - **Different protocols**
      - **Translates** one network protocol into another
      - Resolves hardware and software **incompatibilities**
      - `Systems network architecture (SNA)` gateway connecting microcomputer network to mainframe host

---

- Data rates: 100 Mbps to more than 40 Gbps
- **Close** physical proximity
  - Very high-speed transmission
- Star, ring, bus, tree, and hybrid
  - Normally used
- Transmission **medium**: varies
- Factors determining transmission medium
  - Cost, data rate, reliability, **number of devices** supported, and **distance** between units

---

### Metropolitan Area Network

- Configuration **spanning area** larger than LAN
- Several blocks of buildings to entire city
- Not exceeding **100 km** circumference
- May be owned and operated as **public utilities**
  - Means for **internetworking** several `LANs`
- High-**speed** network often configured as a `logical ring`

---

### Wide Area Network

- Interconnects communication **facilities**: different parts of a country or world
  - Operated as part of public utility
- Uses common **carriers’** communications lines
  - **Telephone** companies
- Uses broad range of communication **media**
  - **Satellite**, **microwaves**
- WANs generally **slower** than LANs
  - Examples: `ARPANET` (first WAN), `Internet` (most widely recognized WAN)

---

### Wireless Local Area Network

- LAN using **wireless technology** to connect computers or workstations
- Located within range of network
- **Security** vulnerabilities
- **Open** architecture; difficulty keeping intruders out

- In a `WLAN`, wireless-enabled nodes connect to the cabled `LAN` via `access points (APs)`, if they are located within the range of the device sending the signal.
