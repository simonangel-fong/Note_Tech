## File Manager

- Arrangement of **records within files**
- All files composed of **records**
- **Modify** command
  - Request to access record within a file

---

### Record Format

- **Fixed-length** records
  - **Direct access**: easy
  - Record **size** critical
  - Data stored in **fixed length fields** (top) that extends **beyond** the field limit is **truncated**.
- **Variable-length** records
  - Direct **access**: **difficult**
  - **No empty** storage space and **no character truncation**
    - Data stored in **variable** length fields (bottom) is **not truncated**.
  - `File descriptor` **stores** record format
  - Used with files accessed **sequentially**
    - Text files, program files
    - **Index** used to access records

---

### Physical File Organization

- **Record** arrangement and **medium** characteristics
- **Magnetic disks** file organization

  - **Sequential**, **direct**, **indexed** sequential

- File organization **scheme selection** considerations
  - Data **volatility**
  - File **activity**
  - File **size**
  - **Response** time

---

### Sequential record organization

- Records **stored** and **retrieved** **serially**
  - One after the other
- **Easiest** to **implement**
- File **search**: beginning **until** record found
- **Optimization** features may be built into system
  - Select **key field** from record and **sort** before storage
  - Complicates maintenance **algorithms**
  - **Preserve** original **order** when records **added**, deleted

---

### Direct record organization

- **Direct access** files
- Requires direct access storage device implementation
  - **Random organization**
  - **Random access** files
- **Relative address record** identification
  - Known as `logical addresses`
  - **Computed** when records stored and retrieved
- **Hashing** algorithms
  - Transform each key into a **number**

---

- **Advantages**
  - **Fast** record access
  - **Sequential access** if starting at first relative address and incrementing to next record
  - Updated more **quickly** than sequential files
  - **No preservation** of records order
  - **Adding, deleting** records is **quick**
- **Disadvantages**
  - **Hashing** algorithm **collision**: records with unique keys may generate the same logical address

---

### Indexed sequential record organization

- Best of `sequential` and `direct access`
- `Indexed Sequential Access Method (I S A M)` software
- Advantage: **no collisions** (no hashing algorithm)
  - Generates `index file` for record **retrieval**
  - Divides **ordered** `sequential file` into **equal sized blocks**
  - Each **entry** in index file contains the `highest record key` and `physical data block location`
  - **Search** `index file`
- Overflow areas

---

### Physical Storage Allocation

- `File manager` works with files
  - As **whole units**
  - As **logical units** or `records`
- Within file
  - Records must have **same format**
  - Record **lengths** may **vary**
  - Every `record` in a **file** must have the **same format** but can be of **different sizes**,
- `Records` subdivided into `fields`
  - **Application** programs manage `record` structure
- File storage
  - Refers to `record storage`

---

### Levels in a File Management System

- File Manager:
  - basic file system > **access control module** > Logical File system ||
- Device Manager:
  - ||Physical File System > **Device Interface Module** > Device

---

- Level implementation

  - **Structured** and **modular** programming techniques
  - Hierarchical
    - **Highest module** passes information to **lower module**

- `Modules` further subdivided
  - More specific `tasks`
- Uses information of basic file system
  - `Logical file system` **transforms** record number to **byte address**

---

- Verification at every level
  - **Directory** level
    - `File system` checks if requested file **exists**
  - **Access control** verification module
    - Determines whether **access allowed**
  - **Logical** file system
    - Checks if requested **byte address** within file **limits**
  - **Device** interface module
    - Checks if storage **device exists**

---

## Access Control

### Access Control Verification Module

- File sharing
  - **Data** files, **user-owned** program files, **system** files
  - Advantages
    - Save **space**, synchronized **updates**, **resource** efficiency
  - Disadvantage
    - Need to **protect** file **integrity**
  - File actions
    - `READ` only, `WRITE` only, `EXECUTE` only, `DELETE` only, or a combination

---

### Access Control Matrix

- Advantages
  - **Easy** to implement
    - Works well in system with **few** files, users
- Disadvantages

  - As files and/or users **increase**, matrix **increases**
  - Possibly beyond main **memory** capacity
  - Wasted **space**: due to null entries

- `RWED`

---

### Access Control Lists

- Modification of a`ccess control matrix` technique

- This method uses **storage space** more **efficiently** than an `access control matrix`.

- Contains **user names** granted file access
  - User denied access grouped under “WORLD”
- Shorten list by **categorizing users**
  - `SYSTEM (ADMIN)`
    - Personnel with **unlimited access** to all files
  - `OWNER (USER)`
    - **Absolute control** over all files **created in own account**
  - `GROUP`
    - All users belonging to appropriate **group** have access
  - `WORLD`
    - All **other** users in system

---

### Capability Lists

- Lists every user and **respective file access**
- Can control access to **devices** as well as to **files**
- Most common
- A `capability list` shows files for each user and requires **less storage space** than an `access control matrix`.

---

### Data Compression

- Saves **space** in files
- Two algorithm types
  - **Lossless**: **retains all data** in the file
    - **Text** or **arithmetic** files applications
  - **Lossy**: **removes some data** without compromising file quality
    - **Image** and **sound** file applications

---

#### Text Compression

- Records with **repeated characters**
  - **Repeated** characters are **replaced with a code**
- Repeated **terms**
  - Compressed using **symbols** to represent most commonly used words
  - University student database common words
    - Student, course, grade, department each are represented with single character
- **Front-end** compression
  - Entry takes given **number** of characters from previous entry that they have in common

---

#### Image and Sound Compression

- **Lossy** compression
  - **Irreversible**: original file **cannot be reconstructed**
- Compression algorithm highly **dependent on file type**
  - JPEG: still images
  - MPEG: video images
- `International Organization for Standardization (ISO)`
  - World’s leading developer of international standards

---

## UNIX/Linux Directory Listings

### Directory Listings

- “long listing”

  - **Eight information pieces** for each file
    - **Access control**,
    - **number** of **links**,
    - name of the **group** and **owner**,
    - **byte size** of the file,
    - date and time of **last modification**,
    - **filename**

- This listing of the permissions granted to these three files and one directory show the exact permissions granted to the **User**, **Group**, and **World** for each entity listed here.

---

- First column
  - Shows file type and access **privileges** for each file
    - First character: nature of **file** or **directory**
    - Next three characters: access privileges granted file **owner**
    - Next three characters: access privileges granted other user’s **group members**
    - Last three characters: access privileges granted to users at large (**system-wide**)

---

- Second column
  - Indicates **number of links** (number of **aliases**)
    - Referring to **same physical file**
- `Aliases`
  - Important UNIX feature: support file sharing
    - Several users work together on same project
  - Shared files appear in different directories belonging to different users
  - **Filename**: may be **different** from directory to directory
  - Eventually number will indicate when file is no longer needed: can be deleted

---

## Windows File Management

### File Management

- Windows current **versions**
  - Designed to be **independent of file system** on which they operate
- `Virtual file`
  - **Primary file handling concept** (current Windows versions)
  - Programs perform **I/O** on **virtual files**
  - `File handles` manipulate them
  - `Executive file object` representing all I/O sources and destinations

---

- `Processes` call native `file object services` to read from or write to file
- `I/O manager` **directs** `virtual file` **requests**
  - Real files, file directories, physical devices, or other system-supported destinations
- `File objects`
  - **Hierarchical** names
  - Protected by object-based **security**
  - Support **synchronization**
  - Handled by object services

---

- **Opening file**
  - Process supplies file’s **name** and **type of access** required
- `File objects` bridge gap
  - Between **physical devices**’ characteristics and **directory structures**, **file system** structures, and **data formats**

---

- `File object`
  - **Memory-based** representation of shareable **physical resources**
  - Contains only **data** unique to an `object handle`
- `File`
  - Contains **data** to be shared
- New file object **created** with new set of handle-specific **attributes**
  - Each time process opens a `handle`

---

| Attribute            | Purpose                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Filename**         | Identifies the **physical** file to which the `file object` refers.                                                                   |
| **Device type**      | Indicates the **type of device** on which the file resides.                                                                           |
| **Byte** offset      | Identifies the **current location** in the file (valid only for synchronous I/O).                                                     |
| **Share mode**       | Indicates whether **other callers** can open the file for read, write, or delete operations while it is still being used by a caller. |
| **Open mode**        | Indicates whether I/O is **synchronous** or **asynchronous**, **cached** or not cached, sequential or random, and so on.              |
| **File disposition** | Indicates whether to **delete** the file after closing it.                                                                            |

---

- Mapped **file I/O**: important I/O system feature
  - Achieved through **cooperation** between **I/O system** and **VM Manager**
  - `Memory-mapped files` exploit VM capabilities
- `Cache manager` uses mapped I/O
  - Manages its `memory-based cache`
- File management system
  - Supports **long filenames**
    - Include spaces and special characters
  - Automatically shortens filenames when required

---

### Access Control Example

| Share Permissions | NTFS Permissions     | User Access?         |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Full Control      | **Full Control**     | Full Control         |
| Change            | Modify               | Modify               |
| **Read**          | Read & Execute       | Read & Execute       |
|                   | List Folder Contents | List Folder Contents |
|                   | Read                 | **Read**             |
|                   | Write                | Write                |

---

### PowerShell

- Modes:
  - `d` - Directory
  - `a` - **Archive**
  - `r` - **Read-only**
  - `h` - **Hidden**
  - `s` - **System**
  - `l` - Reparse point, **symlink**, etc.

---

## Android File Management

- **Linux-managed** at the **kernel** level
- `User ID`: the part of the operating system that is the **user’s own protected mode** and that allows it to **manage the files** it creates and executes
  - Each **application** has its **own**
  - **Not shared**: **no** other apps can **read** or **alter** the **app’s files**
  - Two apps with **same User ID**: data is **shared**
- **Supplementary apps**
  - Necessary for file manipulation tasks
