## Security and Ethics

### Authentication Protocols

- Verifying authorization of individual accessing system
- `Kerberos`

  - **Network authentication protocol**
  - Provides **strong authentication** for **client/server applications**
  - Uses **strong cryptography** - Hiding true meaning of message
  - Requires **systematic revocation of access rights from clients**
    - Who no longer deserve access

- Using `Kerberos`, when the `client` attempts to access the `database server`.
  - The `user` is **authenticated** and **receives a ticket** for the session.
  - Once the **ticket is issued**, the client and database server can **communicate** at will (b).
  - Without the ticket, or when the ticket **expires**, access is **denied**.

---

### Encryption

- Extreme protection method
  - **Sensitive data** put into **secret code**
  - System **communication**
    - Data **encrypted**, **transmitted**, **decrypted**, **processed**
- Disadvantages
  - Increased **system overhead**
  - System dependent on encryption process itself

---

### How Encryption Works

- Involves a `public key` and a `private key`
- `Private key`
  - Pair of two **prime numbers** (usually 75 or more digits each)
  - Chosen by private message recipient
- `Public key`
  - Third number: **product** of the **two prime numbers**
  - Posted **publicly**
  - Encryption software inserts the public key as a variable in confidential message

---

### Sniffers and Spoofing

- `Sniffers`
  - Process of **capturing and analyzing data packets** as they travel across a network
  - Programs on computers **attached to network**
    - **Peruse** data packets as they pass by
    - **Examine** each packet for specific information
    - Particularly problematic in **wireless** networks
- `Spoofing`
  - Assailant **fakes IP address** of Internet server
  - **Changes address** recorded in packets sent over Internet
  - Unauthorized users may **impersonate** trusted sites in order to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access.

---

### Password Management

- Basic techniques protect hardware and software
  - Good passwords
  - Careful user training

---

#### Password Construction

- Good password
  - **Unusual**, **memorable**, not obvious, and **changed often**
- Password files
  - Stored in **encrypted** form

---

- Good password techniques
  - Use minimum of **eight characters**
    - Including **numbers** and **symbols**
  - Create **misspelled word**
    - Join bits of phrases into word easy to remember
  - Follow certain **pattern** on the keyboard
  - Create **acronyms** from memorable sentences
  - Use **upper and lowercase** characters (if allowed)
  - **Avoid words** in any dictionary

---

#### Typical Password Attacks

- `Dictionary attack`
  - Method of **breaking encrypted passwords**
  - Requirements
    - Copy of encrypted **password file**
    - **Algorithm** used to encrypt passwords
  - Prevention
    - **“Salt”** user passwords with extra **random bits**
    - Makes dictionary attacks more difficult and time consuming than guessing obvious passwords

---

#### Password Alternatives

- `Biometrics`
  - Science and technology of identifying individuals
    - Based on each person’s **unique biological characteristics**
  - Current research focus
    - Analysis of human **face**, **fingerprints**, **hand measurements**, iris/**retina**, **voice** prints
  - Positively identifies person being scanned
  - Critical factor
    - Reducing margin of **error**
  - **Expensive**

---

- `Picture passwords`
  - **Graphics** and pattern clicks
  - Involves touch screen, mouse, or other pointing device
  - Establish sequence of clicks on photo/illustration
    - Repeat sequence to gain access
  - Advantages
    - Eliminates keyboard entries
      - Resistant to **dictionary attack**
- `Password salting`
  - Adding **random characters** before **encryption**

---

### Social Engineering

- Technique
  - System intruders **gain access to information** about a legitimate user
  - Learn active passwords
    - **Looking** in and around user’s desk for written reminder
    - **Trying** logon ID as password
    - Searching logon scripts
    - Telephoning friends and coworkers to learn information (family member names, pet names, vacation destinations, hobbies, car model)

---

- `Phishing`
  - Intruder **pretends to be legitimate entity**
    - Asks unwary user to reconfirm personal and/or financial information
- Default passwords
  - Pose unique vulnerabilities
    - Widely known
  - Routinely shipped with hardware or software
  - Routinely passed from one hacker to next
  - Change immediately

---

## Ethics

- Ethical behavior: “be good and do good”
  - `IEEE` and `ACM` issued standard of ethics in 1992
  - Apparent lack of computing ethics
    - Significant departure from other professions
- **Consequences** of **ethical lapses**

  - Illegally **copied** software: **lawsuits** and **fines**
  - **Plagiarism**: illegal and punishable by law
  - **Eavesdropping** on e-mail, data, or voice communications: sometimes illegal and usually unwarranted
  - **Cracking (hacking)**
    - Owner and users question validity of system data
  - Unethical **use** of technology
    - Clearly the wrong thing to do

- Activities to teach ethics
  - Publish **policies** clearly stating actions tolerated
  - **Teach** regular seminar including real-life case histories
  - Conduct open **discussions** of ethical questions

## Windows Security Management

- Windows **network** operating systems
  - Provide **object-based** security model
  - Security **object**
    - Represents any **resource** in system (file, device, process, program, or user)
  - Allows **administrators** to give precise **security access**
    - Monitor and record how objects used

### Windows biggest concern

- Aggressive **patch management** needed
- Combat many **viruses** and **worms**

---

- Multilayered security system
  - **First** security layer: **password** management
  - Second security layer: **file access** security
    - Distinguishes between **owners** and **groups**
    - Users **decide operation types person** is allowed to perform on a file
    - Gives user **auditing capabilities**: automatically tracks who uses files and how files used

---

### Security Terminology

- Built-in security
  - Necessary element for managers of Web servers and networks
  - **Requires authentication mechanism** allowing client to prove identity to server
    - **Client** supplies **authorization information**
    - **Server** uses information: **determines specific access rights** given to client
  - Provides **data integrity** using various methods
- Windows operating systems feature `Kerberos` security

- `Kerberos` security
  - **Authentication** (mutual), data **integrity**, and data **privacy**
  - Each **domain** has **own** `Kerberos` server
  - Microsoft implemented standard Kerberos **protocol**
  - Microsoft separates distributed security services **users** from their **providers**
    - Supports many options without unusable complexity

---

## Conclusion

- A system is only as good as the integrity of stored data

  - Single security breach damages system’s integrity
    - Catastrophic or otherwise
    - Accidental or otherwise
  - Damaged integrity threatens viability of:
    - Best-designed system, its managers, its designers, and its users

- Vigilant security precautions are essential
