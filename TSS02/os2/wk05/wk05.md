## Network Organization Concepts

### Addressing Conventions

- Addressing **protocols**
  - Fulfill need to **uniquely identify users**
  - Closely related to site **network topology** and **geographic location**
- **Distinction** between local and global name
  - **Local name** within its own system
  - **Global name** outside its own system
    - Must follow standard name conventions (length, formats)

---

- Example: Internet address
  - `someone@fanshawec.ca`
  - `Periods` and `@` sign: separate components
  - `Domain Name Service (DNS)` protocol
    - General-purpose data query service
    - Hierarchical
- Domain names read **left to right**
  - **Logical** use to **host** machine
  - Host machine to **net** machine
  - Net machine to **cluster**
  - Cluster to **network**

---

### Routing Strategies

- `Router`
  - Internetworking device (primarily software-driven)
  - **Directs traffic**
    - Between two **different types** of LANs
    - Between two **network segments** (different protocol addresses)
  - `Network layer` operation
  - Role changes (network designs changes)
- Connects sites
  - To other sites and Internet

---

- Router **functions**
  - **Securing** information
    - Generated in predefined areas
  - Choosing **fastest** route
    - From one point to another
  - Providing **redundant** network connections
- Routing protocol considerations
  - Addressing, address resolution, message format, error reporting
- Address resolution
  - **Maps hardware address**

---

- Message **formats**
  - Allow performance of protocol functions
    - **Finding** new network nodes
    - Determine whether they work (**testing**)
    - **Reporting** error conditions
    - **Exchanging** routing information
    - Establishing connections (**transmit** data)
- Most widely used Internet **routing protocols**
  - `Routing information protocol (RIP)`
  - `Open shortest path first (OSPF)`

---

#### `Routing information protocol (RIP)`

- Path **selection** based on **node** and **hop** number
  - Between source and destination
- Path with **smallest number of hops**: always chosen
- Advantage
  - Easy to **implement**
- Disadvantages
  - No consideration: **bandwidth**, data **priority**, network **type**
  - Update and reissue **routing table**: changes or not
  - Tables propagate: **router** to **router**

---

#### `Open shortest path first (OSPF)`

- Network **state** determined **first**
- Transmission path selected
- **Update messages** sent when changes in routing environment **occur**
  - **Reduces** number of **messages** in internetwork
  - **Reduces message size**: not sending entire table
- Disadvantages
  - Increased **memory usage**
  - Bandwidth savings offset by higher **CPU usage**
  - Shortest path **calculation**

---

### Transport Protocol Standards

- Network usage grew quickly (1980s)
- Need to **integrate** dissimilar network devices
  - Different vendors
- Creation of single universally adopted network architecture
  - Two models: `OSI` reference model and `TCP/IP`

---

#### OSI Reference Model

- ISO universal network architecture creation
- Basis for connecting **open systems**
  - Distributed applications processing
- “Open”
  - Connect **any** two systems conforming to reference model and related standards
    - Vendor independent
- Similar **functions** collected **together**
  - Seven logical clusters (`layers`)

---

- Layer 1: `physical layer`
  - Describes mechanical, **electrical**, and functional specifications
  - Transmits bits over communication line
    - Examples: 100Base-T, RS449, C C I T T V.35
- Layer 2: `data link layer`
  - Establishes and controls **physical communications** path before data sent
  - Transmission **error checking**
  - Problem resolution (on other side)
    - Examples: HDLC and SDLC
- Layer 3: `network layer`
  - Addressing and routing services **moving data through network** to destination
- Layer 4: `transport layer`
  - Maintains reliable **data transmission** between end users
    - Example: `Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)`
- Layer 5: `session layer`
  - Provides **user-oriented connection** service
  - Transfers data over communication lines
    - Example: `TCP/IP`
- Layer 6: `presentation layer`
  - **Data manipulation** functions common to **many applications**
    - **Formatting**, compression, and **encryption**
- Layer 7: `application layer`
  - Application **programs**, **terminals**, and computers
    - Access network
  - Provides user **interface**
  - **Formats** user data before passing to lower layers

---

#### TCP/IP Model

- `Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)`
  - **Oldest** transport protocol standard
  - Internet communications basis
  - `File-transfer protocol`: send **large** files error-free
  - `TCP/IP`
    - Emphasizes internetworking
    - Provides connectionless services
  - Organizes communication system: **three components**
    - **Processes**, **hosts**, and **networks**
  - **Four layers**
    - Application Layer (Application + presentation)
    - Host-host layer (Session + Transport)
    - Internet layer (Network)
    - Network access layer (Data + physical)

---

- `Network access layer` (data link layer)
  - Protocols provide **access to communication network**
  - **Flow** control, **error** control between hosts, **security**, and **priority** implementation performed
- `Internet layer`
  - Equivalent to OSI model **network layer** performing **routing** functions
  - Implemented within **gateways** and **hosts**
  - Example: `Internet Protocol (IP)`

---

- `Host-host layer` (transport layer)
  - Transfer data **between two processes**
    - Different host computers
  - Error checking, flow control, and manipulate connection control signals
  - Example: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- `Process/application layer`
  - Protocols for computer-to-computer **resource sharing**
