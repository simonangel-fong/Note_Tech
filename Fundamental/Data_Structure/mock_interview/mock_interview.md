Who is responsible for doing deployment? How often do you deploy?
How do you think about code correctness?
When something goes wrong, how do you handle it? Do devs get shamed for breaking the build?
How/when do developers talk to non-developers? Is it easy to talk to the people who are will be using your product?
Can I see some code the team I’m interviewing for has written? (from an open-source project you work on, for example)

How are decisions made? Is architecture dictated top down? Are ideas from anyone welcomed? If so, in what scope/context?
How are disagreements solved - both technical disagreements and other kinds? What happens when personalities clash?
Can you tell me about a time when you’ve had to let someone go?
Is there a written roadmap all developers can see? How far into the future does it extend? How closely is it followed?
How is performance evaluated?
Quality of life
How much vacation do people get? If there’s “unlimited” vacation, how much vacation do people normally take?
Is it possible to take sabbaticals or unpaid vacation?
How many women work for you? What’s your process for making sure you have diversity in other ways?
How many hours do people work in an average week? In your busiest weeks?
Is variability tolerated or is everyone expected to be on the same schedule?
What time do people normally leave work?
Would I need to be on call? How often?
How often are there emergencies or times when people have to work extra hours?
What is your turnover rate like? How many devs were hired last year and how many left?
What’s your retention rate of women over 1.5 years? Do you think you could’ve done anything differently to keep people who left?
Do people work on the weekend?
Do people check in when they’re on vacation? How often?
Is it possible to work from home, say, 1 or 2 days a week? Does anyone do this? (can be a nice option to have)
Does this position require travel? How often?
As many of these as possible are “statistical” questions – a company may say that they “don’t have hours”, but if everyone leaves at 9pm that’s not a good sign.

Is there any sort of institutionalized way of dealing with plateauing or preventing burnout? (Expecting to hear about rotation of duties or location, sabbaticals.)
