## Computational Complexity

- Complexity Analysis

- As programmers, we often find ourselves asking the same two questions over and over again:
  - How much **time** does this algorithm need to finish?
  - How much **space** does this algorithm need for its computation?

## Big-O Notation

- Big-O notation gives an **upper bound** of the computational complexity of an algorithm in the **worst case**.
- This helps us quantify performance of algorithms as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.

- Complexities ordered in from smallest to largest (n - The size of the input)
  - Constant Time: O(1)
  - Logarithmic Time 对数的: O(log(n))
  - Linear Time: O(n)
  - Linearithmic Time: O(nlog(n))
  - Quadratic Time 二次的: O(n2)
  - Cubic Time: O(n3)
  - Exponential Time: O(bn), b > 1
  - Factorial Time: O(n!)
