## Organizations and Information Systems (ERP, CRM, SCM)

### Fundamental Ways For Achieving Competitive Advantage

- There are two basic ways to develop competitive advantage through systems:
  - Changing the **product**:
    - By introducing **new products or services** or **enhancing current** products or services
  - Business **processes**:
    - Organizations use technology to help lock in customers, reduce costs, and create entry barriers for competitors in the market

---

### Business Functions and Functional Systems

- Porter’s value chain model
- Two types of activities:
  - Primary: **main core parts** of the goods/services
  - Support: **secondary** or ancillary to the main goods or services produced
- Classification determined by the organization and what it produces

---

- Primary activities
  - Relate directly to organization’s **customers and products**
    - Marketing and sales
    - Inbound logistics
    - Operations and manufacturing
    - Outbound logistics
    - Service and support

---

- Support activities
  - Human resource
  - Accounting and infrastructure
  - Procurement
  - Technology activities

---

- `business functions`

  - Primary and support activities in organizations

- `Functional Systems`

  - It facilitate the work of a single department or business function.
  - Examples:
    - Accounting systems,
    - HR Systems,
    - Sales systems(When they are integrated it will become ERP)

- `Separate Functional Systems`
  - When **separate functional system** are implemented, data will also be **in different data bases** and to generate a report or filter the data, manager will **make separate query** on all system and then manually integrate the data.
- `Cross-Functional Systems`
  - **Cross-departmental systems** operate **across** departmental **boundaries**, designed to **reduce isolation** systems caused by functional systems
  - Transition from functional systems to centralized-functional systems is difficult
  - **Integrated** processing **needs** many departments to **coordinate activities**

---

### Typical Functional Systems

- Marketing and Sales
  - Product management,
  - Sales forecasting,
  - Customer management
- Operations
  - Order management,
  - Inventory management,
  - Customer service
- Manufacturing
  - Inventory,
  - Planning,
  - Scheduling,
  - Manufacturing operations
- Human resources
  - Payroll and compensation
  - Recruiting
  - Assessment
  - Development and training
  - Human resources planning

---

### Using Technology to Improve Business Processes

- Using IT to improve business process **requires understanding** of where **improvements** are possible
- Business process design (redesign) idea
  - Organizations should **not simply automate or improve existing** functional systems
  - “Paving the cowpath” – the **process of making efficient what already exists** – it makes things easier but does not change how they are done
- Establish more efficient business processes that **integrate** the activities of all departments involved **in a value chain**

---

### Integrating Functional Systems: EAI and ERP

- `Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)`

  - An approach to **combine different app**s which will work together using a special layer called **middleware**, this layer will work as a **bridge to connect different functional systems together**

![EAI](./pic/EAI.png)

- `Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)`
  - A second approach to combining functional systems, **one central database** is combined with a set of **standard processes** built on top of the database to ensure integration between functional system.

---

### Challenges of Implementing Business Process Changes

- Process design projects are expensive and difficult; three reasons for this are:
  - There is a lot of **detailed work** to be done
  - Hard to **estimate**.
  - Many people like change but do **not want to change**
  - May take a long time

---

### Industry Standard Processes

- Many early business process design projects **failed** because they were **tailor-made**
- Software vendors designed integrated applications, with **built-in industry standard processes**
  - Integrate **activities across departments**
  - **Save costs** of new process design
    - Examples: Oracle, Salesforce.com, Microsoft, or SAP

---

## ERP Systems

- `Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)`

  - **Support primary business processes** and human resource, accounting support processes
  - integrate sales, order, inventory, manufacturing, and customer service activities
  - provide software, **pre-designed databases**, procedures, and job descriptions for organization-wide process integration

- Benefits
  - Efficient business **processes**
  - **Inventory** reduction
  - **Lead-time** reduction
  - Improved **customer service**
  - Greater, real-time **insight** into organization
  - Higher profitability

---

## CRM Systems

- `Customer Relationship Management (CRM)`

  - Provides single repository for **data about customer interactions**
  - Supports all direct value chain activities involving customers
    - Attracting, selling, managing, delivering, and supporting customers
  - Type of cross-functional system
    - Developed to **overcome problems in functional silos**

- Purpose
  - maximize the value of the existing customer
- Two types of applications for RM applications
  - **Sales Management applications**
    - support **sales** to existing customers
    - Ensures sales management has sufficient information to prioritize and allocate sales time, efforts
  - Integrated **CRM applications**
    - store data in a **single database**
    - CRM processes can be linked to one another

---

## SCM Systems and SRM systems

- `Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems`

  - **interorganizational** systems, enable **flow of goods** from suppliers to customers

- `Supply chain`
  - network of organizations, facilities
  - transforms **raw** materials into **products** delivered to **customers**
  - Involves customers, retailers, distributors, manufacturers, suppliers, transportation companies, warehouses, inventories, and some means for transmitting messages and information among the organizations involved

---

- **Supplier** is any organization that **sells** something to the organization that has the SRM application
- `Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)`
  - Business process for **managing all contacts** between an organization and its **suppliers**
  - Supports both the **inbound logistics**(primary activity) and the **procurement**(support activity)
- Support basic business processes
  - source, purchase, and settle

---

### Benefits on Supply Chain Performance

- Reduce **costs** of buying and selling
- Increase supply chain **speed**
- Reduce size and cost of **inventories**
- Improve **delivery scheduling**
  - enable just-in-time inventory
