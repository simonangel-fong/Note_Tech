    - Builds **confidence among customers**, investors, and partners by demonstrating secure and compliant systems.

---

- **Information Systems `Ethics`**

  - `Information Systems Ethics`
    - the **moral principles and standards** that **guide the use** of **technology** and **information** within **organizations and society**.
  - Simple Example
    - A company develops a mobile app that **collects user location data**. Ethically, the company should:
      - **Inform** users clearly about data collection and **obtain** their **consent**.
      - Use the data **only for stated purposes** (e.g., improving services), **not sell** it without permission.
      - **Protect** the data from **unauthorized access**.
      - **Unethical behavior** would be secretly **tracking** users or sharing their data **without consent**, **violating their privacy**.

---

  - `Identity theft`
    - the **unauthorized use** of **personal information**, such as a person’s name, address, date of birth, and social insurance number, to **commit fraud** or other **crimes**
  - It is a rapidly **growing crime in Canada** and can be used to commit other crimes.

---

- **What Is PIPEDA?**

- The `Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)`
  - a **Canadian law** that **balances** **individuals' right** to privacy with **organizations' need** to collect, use, and share personal information for business purposes.
  - It governs how data is **collected** and **used**, ensuring that **individuals know** **what** information is collected, **how** it will be used, and that it is secure, accurate, and up to date.
  - PIPEDA also **prohibits** using personal information for purposes **other than what was agreed upon**, such as selling it. The law helps **foster trust in e-commerce**
  - does **not fully eliminate risks** like `information theft`.

---

- **What Types of Security Threats Do Organizations Face?**
- Organizations face **three main sources** of security threats:

  - **Natural Events and Disasters**:
    - Events like **fires, floods**, earthquakes, or other natural disasters that can **disrupt operations** or cause **data loss**.

## Project Management

- **Why is `Formalized Project Management` Necessary?**

- `Formalized project management`

  - the **aproach** of using **structured processes**, **methodologies**, and **tools** to plan, execute, monitor, and control **projects**.
  - refers to the structured **approach** and set of **methodologies** used to **plan, execute, monitor, control, and complete** projects efficiently and effectively.

- `Formalized project management`
  - **necessary** for **large-scale projects**
    - provides a **structured approach** to managing **complex tasks, resources, timelines, and risks**.
- In **small companies**, **informal** management may suffice for **simple** projects, but for **medium** and **large** organizations, where projects are intricate, involve substantial resources, and **impact various business processes**, a formalized approach is critical.
- It **ensures** that projects are
  - **completed on time**, 时间
  - within **budget**, 钱
  - and to the required **quality standards**.质量
- **Without** formalized project management, companies **risk**
  - significant **delays**,
  - cost **overruns**,
  - and low team **morale**.
- Methods like `Agile`, `Scrum`, and Six Sigma offer frameworks that help **streamline** project management, ensuring effective execution and delivery.

---

- **What are the Trade-Offs in `Requirements`, `Cost`, and `Time`? What are the `Dimensions` of Project Management?**

- In project management, **requirements**, **cost**, and **time** form a **trade-off triangle**.

  - **Increasing** project **requirements** (features or functionality) typically leads to **higher** **costs** and **longer schedules**.
  - shortening the **timeline** may require **cutting features** or increasing **cost**.

- `Dimensions of Project Management`:

- refer to the **key aspects** that must be **effectively managed** to **ensure a project's success**.
- These typically include:
  - **Scope**: Defining and controlling what is **included** in the project to meet objectives without unnecessary additions.
  - **Time**: **Planning** and managing the **project schedule** to ensure **timely completion**.
  - **Cost**: **Budgeting** and controlling **expenses** to keep the project **within financial limits**
  - **Quality**: Ensuring deliverables **meet the required standards** and stakeholder **expectations**.
  - **Resources**: Allocating and managing people, equipment, and materials efficiently.
  - **Risk**: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating **potential issues** that could **impact** the project.

---

- **How Does a `Work Breakdown Structure` Drive Project Management?**

- `work breakdown structure (WBS)`

  - a **hierarchy of the tasks** required to **complete** a project.
  - The WBS for a large project is huge; it might entail hundreds or even thousands of tasks.

- A `Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)` **drives** project management by using a `divide-and-conquer strategy`.
  - It **breaks** large tasks into **smaller**, **manageable** units, making it easier to **estimate** **time, cost, and resources**.
  - Each task in the WBS results in a **deliverable** (e.g., document, prototype), allowing progress to be **tracked** clearly using `Gantt chart`

- The WBS forms the foundation for creating the `Baseline WBS`, which includes planned **tasks**, **durations**, **dependencies**, and **resources**.
- Tools like `Microsoft Project` use this baseline

---

- **What is the Biggest Challenge for `Planning` a Systems Development Project?**

- The biggest challenge is `scheduling`.
- Large projects involve **thousands** of tasks, and **estimating time** accurately for each is **difficult**.
- Even **small miscalculations** can **throw off** the entire plan.
  - When **no** suitable software exists to license, companies face **uncertainty** in **development timelines**.
  - Some **admit the uncertainty** and manage resources flexibly, while others try to estimate using **past projects** or **code metrics**, though this remains highly complex.

---

- **What are the Biggest Challenges for `Managing` a Systems Development Project?**

- `Unexpected events`
  - The **larger and longer** the project, the greater the **chance** of disruption due to an `unanticipated event`.
- **Taking responsibility for requirements**
  - understanding that the information system is built for your business function and managing requirements accordingly.
  - Once the requirements are **known**, the development team will create a **project WBS** and will initiate management **activities** for each of the nine knowledge areas.
  - **Users** must take **responsibility** for managing requirements **changes** and for **avoiding** `requirements creep`.

  - is a **time-boxed iteration** where a Scrum **team** works to **complete a set amount of work**, typically resulting in a potentially releasable product increment.

---

- **Explain the difference between agile and waterfall with examples and explain about scrum Framework and board in Jira.**

- Difference between `Agile` and `Waterfall` (with examples):

  - `Agile` is an **iterative and flexible approach** where product development is **broken into** smaller, manageable units delivered in **cycles**.
  - For example, a team releases updates every two weeks, getting regular **feedback** and **adapting** quickly to changes.
  - `Waterfall` is a **linear and sequential approach** where each phase (like requirements, design, implementation) must be **completed before moving to the next**.
    - For example, in **traditional** software projects, the full product is **delivered at the end** after all steps are **completed**.

- `Scrum Framework` and Board in Jira:

  - `Scrum` is a **framework under `Agile`** that uses adaptive, **iterative methods to deliver products** in **short iterations** (called `sprints`).
  - It defines stakeholder **roles**, **breaks** down complex **scopes**, and helps manage **scope changes** effectively.

- A `Scrum board` in Jira **visually tracks progress** during each **sprint** with columns like "**To Do**," "**In Progress**," and "**Done**," helping teams stay aligned and focused on sprint goals.

---

- **What is Kanban and the difference between Kanban, Agile and Scrum?**

- `Kanban` is a **lean, continuous delivery method** that **visualizes the flow of work** using a **board** with stages like `BACKLOG`, `SELECTED FOR DEVELOPMENT`, `IN PROGRESS`, and `DONE`. It focuses on **optimizing workflow** and team **collaboration** **without** fixed **iterations**.

- Difference:
  - `Agile` is the overarching methodology **focused on iterative delivery** and **adaptability**.
  - `Scrum` is a specific **Agile framework** with **time-boxed** iterations (`sprints`).
  - `Kanban` is **not iterative**; it provides a **continuous flow model** based on **priorities** and team capacity.

---

- **What is Confluence, share detail?**

- `Confluence`

  - a **team collaboration software** developed by Atlassian that **serves as a centralized platform** for teams to **work together** and **share information** efficiently.
    - It acts **like a wiki** with advanced content creation tools, making it ideal for **building and maintaining a knowledge repository**.

- `Confluence` is commonly used **alongside** `Jira`—while `Jira` **tracks** project progress, `Confluence` is used to **document** the project details, plans, and decisions.
- It is available in two deployment options:
  - S`aaS (Cloud-based)`: **Subscription-based** and hosted by Atlassian.
  - `Self-hosted`: Installed on **in-house servers** or through `Confluence Data Centers` for enterprise needs.
