  - Need to be developed for right reason

---

### Social Media: Changing the Relationship Between Customers and Business

- **Social media** connect people, and when people get connected, they talk, share, and let friends know what they think about the world
- Social networking was often **ignored by companies at first** – they do not make positive cash flows.
- Companies learned, information and reviews can now be **shared** to millions of people **within seconds**.
- Now, organizations are creating **strategies** that incorporate social networking tools.

- Example:
  - `Molson` in the Community provides space for staff to **share volunteer work** they do on behalf of Molson Canada, in blogs and vlogs.
  - `Big Wild` founded by Canadian parks and Wilderness Society and Mountain Equipment Co-op, provides space to **share pictures and videos of wild spaces,** and connect with others doing same.
  - `Netflix` utilizes social media(Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) to **promote** its original content, interact with viewers, and create buzz around upcoming releases.

---

### IS vs IT

- `Information system (IS)`

  - a system of hardware, software, data, procedures, and people that produces information

- `Information System` refers to:

  - Inventions
  - Standards
  - Products

---

- `Information technology (IT)`

  - represents **raw technology, components** of `IS`
    - Hardware
    - Software
    - Data components

- `IT` alone will not help an organization achieve goals
- `IT` must be **embedded** into an `IS` to help accomplish objectives
- `Technology` must be **combined with people** and **procedure** components
- `Information System` will make `IT` **useful**

---

### Importance of IS
