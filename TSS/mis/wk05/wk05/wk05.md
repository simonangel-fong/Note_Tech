Why do you need to know about databases, and what is their purpose?
What does a database contain?
What is a DBMS, and what does it do?
What is a database application?
What is the difference between databases and where are we headed?

## Databases

- Reasons for learning about database technology:
  - Will database technology facilitate your project goals?
  - How to turn data into a format that provides you with useful information
  - Understand if structural changes are needed, or a new database.
  - Assess if and/or when your company should build their own database.

---

### Purpose of a Database

- Organize and keep track of things
- Keep track of multiple themes
- General rule:
  - Single theme – can store data in a spreadsheet
  - Multiple themes - require a database
- What's a theme?

  - Ex: student grades, student emails, student office visits.

- General rule:
  - Use a spreadsheet for lists of data involving single theme.
  - Use a database for data with multiple themes.

---

### Database

- `Database`:

  - a self-describing collection of integrated records

- Hierarchy of data elements

  - `Byte` is a **character** of data
  - `Bytes` are **grouped** into `columns/fields`
  - `Columns` **grouped** into `rows/records`
  - `Rows` are **grouped** into `tables/files`

- A collection of **tables** plus **relationships** among the rows in those tables, plus **metadata**
  - Tables/Files + relationships + Metadata

---

### Relationships

- Values in one table may relate to rows in other table(s)
- Keys
  - **Column**(s) that **identify unique row** in table
  - Each table has a key
- Foreign keys
  - Keys in a different table than the one in which they reside
- Relational database
  - Databases using tables, keys, and foreign keys

---

### Meta

- `Metadata`
  - Data that describe data
  - Makes databases more useful than spreadsheets
  - Makes databases easier to use

---

### DBMS

- Database Management System (DBMS)

  - Make databases more accessible and useful
  - Program that creates, processes, and administers a database

- `DBMS`:a software program
- `database`: a collection of tables, relationships, and metadata.

- Usually licensed from vendors
  - IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, MySQL (open-source)
- Organizations rarely develop their own

---

- Three main functions of the DBMS
  - **Create** the **database** and its **structures**
    - Create tables and relationships in the database
  - **Process** the database
    - read, insert, modify, or delete data
    - Use Structured Query Language (SQL)
      - international standard for processing a database
  - Provide **tools** to **administer** the database
    - User accounts with passwords, permissions, limits
    - Can be used to set up a security system
    - Used to backup data
    - Add structure to improve performance
    - Remove data

---

### Database Application

- Collection of forms, reports, queries, and application programs that **process a database**
- Databases can have **more then one** **application**
- Each applications can have **multiple** **users**
- Forms, reports, and queries work for **standard functions**

---

### Multi-User Processing

- Common, but poses unique problems
- **Lost-update problem**
  - When two users are using order entry application **at same time**,
  - Some type of locking needed to be able to coordinate user activity
  - Shows need to consider multiple users
  - When unresolved, produces **data conflicts**

---

### Enterprise DBMS and a Personal DBMS

- `Enterprise DBMS`

  - Process **large** organizational and **workgroup databases**
  - Support **many users** and many different database **applications**
  - Examples: IBM’s DB2, Microsoft’s SQL Server, and Oracle’s Oracle

- `Personal DBMS`
  - Designed for **smaller**, simpler database **applications**
  - Supports **fewer** than 100 users, normally fewer than 15
    - Microsoft Access is the only remaining personal DBMS in Microsoft
  - Relational model used to be standard for processing databases
    - because of storage and processing technology, but was not a natural fit with business docs
    - Is no longer being used

---

### Non-Traditional DBMS types

- **NoSQL DBMS**
  - Non-relational,
  - high transaction rates,
  - simple data **structures**,
  - no `ACID`(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) support
  - MongoDB, Cassandra, Dynamo
- NewSQL DBMS:
  - High transactions
  - ACID support
  - May/may not be relational
  - Many players in market now, more coming
- **In-memory DBMS**
  - Databases **processed in main memory**
  - Usually relational
  - SAP HANA, high-volume ACID support with relational query processing
  - Tableau Software, proprietary in-memory DBMS using an extension to SQL

## Cloud

### Networks and Collaboration

- `Collaboration`:

  - when two or more people **work together** to achieve a common **goal**, result, or product

- Effectiveness of a collaborative effort is driven by four critical factors:
  - Communication **skills** and **culture**
  - Communication **systems**
  - **Content** management
  - **Workflow** control

---

#### Communication Systems

- Group members may be travelling or unavailable
- To collaborate, companies use
  - Email
  - virtual private networks
  - Messaging
  - video conferencing

---

#### Content Management

- Related to **intellectual property**
  - Any creative property that can be protected through a trademark, patent, copyright, industrial design, or integrated circuit topography
- Content:

  - **Something of value**, which can be considered an **asset**
  - Can be stored as data, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, websites, text from blogs, Twitter, or discussion boards, graphics, video files and video logs, audio files, etc.

- With multiple users contributing, changing documents, schedules, etc., collaboration **requires**
  - **Synchronizing**
  - **Integrating**
  - Managing data **conflicts**
  - **Tracking** history of changes
  - Managing rights, **privileges** to data
  - Usually handled by CMA

---

#### Workflow

- **Process or procedure** in which content is created, edited, used, discarded
- Focuses on internal delivery of a good/service to employees (contrast with business process, which delivers externally to customers/users)
- ordering of tasks
- rejected changes
- Exceptions

- `Network externality`:
  - the larger the number of people using a network, the more valuable that network becomes

---

### Computer Network

- `Computer network`
  - Collection of computers that **communicate** with one another **over transmission media**
- Transmission media
  - physical media (copper cable, optical fibre)
  - wireless media (light or radio frequencies)

| Type                       | Characteristic                                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local Area Network (LAN)   | Computers connected at **a single physical site**           |
| Wide Area Network (WAN)    | Computers connected between two or more **separated sites** |
| The Internet and intranets | Networks of networks                                        |

---

#### LAN

- Features
  - LAN Is located **geographically close together** such as in a single room, floor, building or campus etc.
  - Typically facilitates **high-speed connections**.
    - High-speed transmission only **over short distances.**
  - Can include both **wired and wireless networks**, especially for portable devices like laptops and tablets
  - Is **owned**, controlled and managed typically by an **individual or a single organisation**

---

#### Key features of WAN

- Have no **geographical** restrictions
- **Span** longer **distances**, such as a city, a state, a nation, the whole world or even the interplanetary galaxy
- Have speeds that are typically **lower** than those of LANs
- Are **mostly wired**, but can also include wireless technologies, such as satellite and microwave links
- Have **no single owner**, manager or controller, but are **collectively and cooperatively owned and managed** by various organisations.
- Extends over a **large geographic area** for the primary purpose of computer networking
- WAN covers a broad area (e.g., any network whose communications links cross metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries over a long distance).

---

### Cloud

- Elastic leasing,
- of pooled computer resources,
- Over the Internet

---

#### Elastic Leasing

- Company sets up a **private Internet** within the company
  - Writes applications for processing inventory, using Web services standards
  - Users access inventory JavaScript sent to users’ browsers
  - Users include sales, shipping, etc.

---

### Cloud Services Secure

- Internet is a jungle of threats to data and computing infrastructure, companies need to be armed against the threats
- Combination of technologies often used now:
  - **Virtual private network**
  - **Private cloud**
  - **Virtual private cloud**

---

#### VPN

- Is a p**rivate pathway** over a **public or shared network**
- Uses public Internet to create appearance of a **private connection** on **secure** network
- Client (company, e.g.) establishes public connection to the Internet
- VPN software on the remote user’s computer establishes a **connection (tunnel)** with the **server**

---

#### Private Cloud

- Owned and operated by an organization for itself
- Company creates the **private internet**
- With applications using Web services **standards**
- Creates a farm of **servers**
- **Manages** the servers
- Provide **security** from within the infrastructure

- Difficult, and rare to do
  - Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle

---

#### Virtual Private Cloud

- Subset of public cloud with highly **restricted, secure access**
- `VPC` built on top of a **public infrastructure**
- “tunneling” on steroids
- **Sensitive data** can be stored on its own infrastructure, and **less** sensitive data on the `Virtual Private Cloud`.
- Gives organizations physical control over some of their data

---

### Remote Action Systems

- `Telediagnosis`:
  - Transmitting **medical reports** and **physician examination** records to a specialist at a different location.
