## Deadlocks

### Deadlock Problem

- Set of blocked **processes** each holding a **resource and waiting** to **get** a resource **held by another process** in the set.
  - E.g. You have 2 disk drive in the system. Process1 and Process2 each hold 1 disk drive and each needs the other one.
  - E.g. Semaphores A and B, initialized to 1

---

### System Model

- System consists of **resources** (CPU cycles, memory space, I/O devices)
- Each process **utilizes** a resource as follows:
  - `Request`.
    - The process **requests** the resource.
    - If the request **cannot be granted immediately** (for example, if the resource is being used by another process), then the requesting process **must wait** until it can acquire the resource.
  - `Use`.
    - The process can **operate on the resource** (for example, if the resource is a printer, the process can print on the printer).
  - `Release`.
    - The process **releases** the resource.

---

### Deadlock Characterization

- `Deadlock` can **occur** if **4 conditions** hold **at the same time**:

  - `Mutual Exclusion`: only **1** process can use **a resource** **at a time**
  - `Hold and Wait`: process **holding** at **least 1** resource is **waiting** to get an **additional resource** being **used by other** processes
  - `No Preemption`: resource can be **released only voluntarily** by process holding it, after process has **completed** its task
  - `Circular Wait`: P0, P1, P2 are waiting processes. P0 waits for P1, P1 waits for P2, P2 waits for P0

- Deadlock with **Mutex Locks**
  - Can occur via **system calls**, **locking** etc.

---

#### Resource-Allocation Graph

- If graph contains **no cycles**, **no** `deadlock`
- If graph contains a **cycle**
  - if only **one instance per resource** type, then `deadlock`
  - if **several instances per resource** type, **possibility** of `deadlock`

---

### Handling Deadlocks

- Ensure that the system will **never enter** a deadlock state:
  - **Deadlock prevention**
  - **Deadlock avoidance**
- Allow the system to enter a deadlock state and then **recover**
- **Ignore** the problem and **pretend** that deadlocks **never occur** in the system; used by **most** operating systems, including `UNIX`

---

#### Deadlock Prevention

- **Restrain the ways requests** can be made
  - 1. **Mutual Exclusion**
    - **not required** for **sharable** resources;
    - must hold for non-sharable resources
  - 2. **Hold and Waiting**
    - must **guarantee** that whenever a process requests a resource, it does **not hold any other resources**
    - Require process to request and be **allocated all its resources** before it begins **execution**, or allow process to request resources only when the process has none
    - Low resource **utilization**; **starvation** possible
  - 3. **No Preemption**
    - If a process that is holding some resources requests another resource that **cannot be immediately allocated** to it, then all resources currently being held are **released**
    - **Preempted resources** are added to the list of resources for which the process is waiting
    - Process will be restarted only when it can regain its old resources, as well as the new ones that it is requesting
  - 4. **Circular Wait**
    - impose a total ordering of all resource types, and require that each

---

#### Deadlock Avoidance

- `Deadlock avoidance`
  - requires that the operating system be **given additional information in advance** concerning which resources a process will request and use during its lifetime.
  - Simplest and most useful model requires that **each process declare the maximum number of resources** of each type that it may need
  - The `deadlock-avoidance algorithm` **dynamically examines** the **resource-allocation state** to ensure that there can **never** be a **circular-wait** condition
  - `Resource-allocation state` is defined by the number of available and allocated resources, and the maximum demands of the processes

---

#### Safe State

- When a process **requests** an available resource, system must decide if **immediate allocation** leaves the system in a `safe state`
- System is in `safe state` if there exists a sequence < P 1, P 2, â€¦, Pn> of ALL the processes in the systems such that for each Pi, the resources that P i can still request can be satisfied by currently available resources + resources held by all the Pj, with j < i

- That is:
  - If Pi resource needs are not immediately available, then Pi can wait until all Pj have finished
  - When Pj is finished, Pi can obtain needed resources, execute, return allocated resources, and terminate
  - When Pi terminates, Pi +1 can obtain its needed resources, and so on

---

- Fact:
  - If a system is in `safe state`, **no** `deadlocks`
    If a system is in `unsafe state`, **possibility** of `deadlock`
- `Avoidance`
  - ensure that a system will **never enter** an `unsafe state`.
