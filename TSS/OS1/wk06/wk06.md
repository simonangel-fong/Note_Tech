## Process Synchronization

- `Process synchronization`

  - a technique that manages **how processes access shared resources** in a computer system
  - a key concept in Operating Systems, essential for efficiently **managing multiple concurrent processes or threads**.

- Task of **coordinating the execution** of processes

  - **No** 2 processes can have **access** to the **same shared data and resources**

- Required in multi-processor system
  - multiple processes running together, more than 1 process trying to gain access to the **same shared resource at the same time**

---

- Process 1 changes the data in a memory location while Process 2 is trying to read the data from the same memory location.
- High probability that the data read by Process 2 will have errors

---

### Goal

- The main objective of process synchronization is to **ensure data integrity**, manage shared resources, and **avoid concurrency** problems such as data corruption, deadlock, and contention.
- Process Synchronization focuses on **preventing conflicts and race conditions** when processes access shared resources or **critical sections** of code.

---

### Features

- **Mutual exclusion** to prevent data corruption
- Enables mechanisms such as `semaphores` and `mutexes`
  - `Semaphores` allow multiple threads or processes to **access** a shared resource **with limited capacity**
  - `mutexes` only allow **one** thread or process to access a shared resource **at a time**
  - Both mechanisms help p**revent race conditions** and ensure that shared resources are accessed in a controlled and synchronized manner.
- **Protection** of critical code from concurrent access
- Prevention algorithms to **avoid deadlocks**

---

### Critical Sections

- `critical section`

  - a **portion of programming code** where a process accesses **shared resources**

- To prevent data inconsistencies and race conditions, **only one process can execute within this section** at any given time
- It serves as a **protected area**, where synchronization mechanisms like `semaphores` or `mutexes` are used to ensure mutual exclusion and allow only one process to operate on the shared data at once

---

- Idea:

  - when **inside** critical section, other process **can’t** be allowed to **touch shared data**

- Steps
  - **Ask** to enter in `entry section`
  - Allows one process to **enter and modify** shared variable in `Critical Section`
  - **Notify** exit with `exit section`
  - Allows other processes **waiting** in the `Entry section` to enter `Critical section`
  - Execute **cleanup** with **remainder section** (optional)
  - All other parts of code

---

- `Critical Section`

  - code which can be **access by a signal process** at a specific point of time.
  - Consists of **shared data resources** that are required by other processes.

- **Entry** to the `critical section` is handled by the `wait()` function – `P()`
- **Exit** from a `critical section` is controlled by the `signal()` function – `V()`

- Only a single process can be executed.
- Other processes, waiting to execute their `critical section`, need to **wait until** the current process **completes** its execution.

---

- Rules for Critical Section
  - Mutual Exclusion
  - Progress
  - Bound Waiting

---

#### Mutual Exclusion

- `Mutual exclusion`

  - guarantees that **only one** process can access a `critical section` **at a time**, **preventing** multiple processes from simultaneously **modifying** shared resources, which could result in data corruption

- Ensuring `mutual exclusion` is essential, and **various** synchronization mechanisms are designed to enforce this principle

- Special **type** of b**inary semaphore**, used to control access to the shared resource
- Includes **priority mechanism** to avoid extended **priority inversion problems**
- Not more than 1 process can execute in its critical section at one time

---

#### Progress

- then one of those waiting processes should be able to enter the critical section without indefinite delay

- Used when **no one** is in the `critical section` and someone **wants** in
- Process not in `reminder section` should decide who should go in

- If **no process** in `critical section` **AND** There are **1+ processes waiting** to enter CS
  - THEN OS must **pick** a process/thread to enter CE

---

#### Bound Waiting

- a condition that limits how many times another process can interrupt a process that wants to enter a critical section. 

- When a process makes a **request** for getting into the `critical section`, there is a specific **limit about number** of processes that can get into their critical section

  - When limit is **reached**, the system must **allow request** to the process to get into its `critical section`.
  - there is a **limit** on **how many times** other processes can enter the critical section **before** the waiting process gets its **turn**, essentially ensuring that no process is left waiting for an excessive amount of time.

  - Example: take a number (think a waiting room, deli)
    - Higher numbers than yours shouldn’t be called first

---

### Critical Section Solution

- `Critical section` plays the main role so that problems must be solved.

- Peterson’s Solution
- Synchronization Hardware
- Mutex Locks
- Semaphore Solution

---

#### Peterson’s Solution

- `Peterson’s Algorithm`

  - a widely recognized solution for **ensuring mutual exclusion** in process synchronization.
  - designed to **control access** to shared resources between two processes, preventing conflicts or data corruption.

- The algorithm **guarantees** that **only one** process can enter the critical section **at any time**, while the **other** process **waits** its turn.
- Peterson’s Algorithm uses two **basic variables**:

  - one to indicate **whose turn** it is to access the critical section
  - another to signal **if** a process is **ready to enter**.

- When **a** process is executing **in** a `critical state`, then the **other** process only executes the **rest** of the code, or the opposite.
  - This method makes sure that only a single process runs in the critical section at a specific time.

---

#### Synchronization Hardware

- Coders can **protect critical resources** using `locking`
- How is sync implemented **in hardware**?
  - Can disable interrupts
    - Hard to scale
  - **Atomic lock** code
    - Atomic = **non-interruptable**
- Intel x86: `LOCK` **prefix** on some instructions
  - Or the LOCK instruction itself

---

#### Mutexes, Mutual Exclusion

- `Mutexes / Mutual Exclusion`

  - **binary variables** that serve as **locks**.
  - When a process **locks a mutex**, it signifies that it has **access** to a `critical section`.
    - **Other** processes attempting to lock the same mutex will be **blocked** until it is released.

- **Condition variables** are used in conjunction with mutexes.
  - They allow processes to **wait** for specific conditions to be met before proceeding.
- Condition variables are effective in scenarios where a process **should pause its execution** until a certain condition is true.

---

#### Semaphore Solution

- `Semaphores`

  - integer variables that **act as counters** to control access to shared resources.
  - They can be used to **signal between processes**, allowing one process to enter a `critical section` while blocking others.

- `MutEx` is good for limiting 1 thread in 1 critical section at once
- What if there’s a limit on resources?
  - Think: going to the club
    - Room capacity = 40
    - Once 40 people are in, don’t let anyone else in until 1 exits
- Two methods: `wait()` and `signal()`

- `wait()`: see if we can get in
- `signal()`: let the semaphore know we’re done

- **Semaphore Types**
  - **Binary**
    - S can be 0 or 1
    - Same as a mutex lock
  - **Counting**
    - S can be 0 -> n

---

- What happens if 2 processes call `wait()` and `signal()` at same time?
  - Should they be in a critical section?
  - Could have busy wait in critical section
    - Busy wait = while(something true) {}

---

- Semaphore w/Queues
  - Could code our OS to provide operations on semaphore
    - **Block**
      - place the thread on hold if semaphore = 0
    - **Wakeup**
      - resume the thread once semaphore > 0 (i.e. someone exits)

---

### Starvation 饥饿

- OS’ allow for **prioritizing processes**, threads
- What if low-priority thread needs access to something **locked** by higher priority threads?
  - May be stuck waiting – starved for resources/time

#### Starvation – Priority Inversion

- Also possible for low-priority thread to be in critical section
- Higher priority thread **blocked until** low-priority finishes in CS
- `Priority Inversion`

  - **low**-priority thread holds **lock** needed by **high**- priority thread

- Solve? `Priority Inheritance Protocol`
  - Make the low-priority task **higher priority** than the high-priority thread

---

### Deadlock Avoidance

- Process Synchronization also addresses the issue of `deadlocks`, which occur when processes are **stuck and unable to proceed** because they are **waiting for resources** held by others.

- Techniques like **deadlock detection and prevention algorithms** are used to ensure that deadlocks are minimized or resolved when they occur. (more on this in a future week)
