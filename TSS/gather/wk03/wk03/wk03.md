## Systems Planning and Selection

### Sources of Projects

- Managers of business units
  - to gain more information or provide new services
- IT managers
  - to make a system more efficient, less costly, or want a new operating environment
- Formal planning groups

  - to improve an existing system in order to help the organization meet its corporate objectives

- 1. Projects are identified by

  - **Top** management
  - **Steering** committee
  - **User** departments
  - Development group or senior **IS staff**

- Top-Down identification

  - Senior management or steering committee
  - Focus is on **global needs** of organization

- Bottom-up identification

  - Business unit or IS group
  - **Don’t reflect** overall goals of the organization

- 2. **Classify** and **rank** development projects

  - What are some of the classifications and/or ranking criteria?

- 3. Select development projects
  - Factors:
    - Current business **conditions**
    - Existing systems and **ongoing** projects
    - Perceived **needs** of the organization
    - **Resource** availability
    - **Evaluation** criteria
    - Perspectives of the decision makers

---

### Outcome and Objectives

- Deliverables and Outcomes

  - Primary deliverable of this phase is a **schedule** of specific IS development projects

- Incremental commitment

  - **Continuous reassessment** of project after each phase

- Objectives

  - `Baseline Project Plan (BPP)`
  - Internal **document**

- `Project Scope Statement`
  - Prepared for external and internal **stakeholders**
  - Provides a high-level **overview** of the project

### Cost-Benefit Analyses

- Determine Benefits

  - **Tangible benefits**

    - Tangible benefits can be measured easily
    - e.g.,
      - Cost reduction and avoidance
      - Error reduction
      - Increased flexibility
      - Increased speed of activity
      - Increased management planning and control

  - **Intangible Benefits**
    - Intangible Benefits cannot be measured easily
    - e.g.,
      - Increased organizational flexibility
      - Increased employee morale
      - Competitive necessity
      - More timely information
      - Promotion of organizational learning and understanding

---

### Economic Feasibility

- Determine Costs

  - `Tangible Costs`
    - Can easily be measured in dollars
    - e.g.,
      - Hardware
  - `Intangible costs`

    - Cannot be easily measured in dollars
    - e.g.,
      - Loss of customer goodwill
      - Loss of employee morale

  - `One-Time Costs`

    - Associated with project **start-up**, **initiation** and **development**
    - Includes:
      - System development
      - New hardware and software purchases
      - User training
      - Site preparation
      - Data or system conversion

  - `Recurring Costs`
    - Associated with **on-going use** of the system
    - Includes:
      - Application software maintenance
      - Incremental data storage expense
      - Incremental communications
      - New software and hardware releases
      - Consumable supplies

---

#### Time value of money (TVM)

- `Time value of money (TVM)`

  - The process of **comparing** present cash **outlays** to future expected returns.

- `Return On Investment`

  - a financial metric that measures how much profit an investment generates relative to its cost.
  - `ROI` = NPV - Cost / cost

- `Break Even Ratio` 盈亏平衡点

  - point where **revenue** exactly **equals costs** and there is neither a profit nor loss;
  - a property to start generating profit

- `Net Present Value`:
  - NPV uses a **discount rate** determined from the company’s cost of capital to establish the present value of a project.
  - The discount rate is used to determine the present value of both cash receipts(benefits) and outlays(costs).
- `Return On Investment`:
  - ROI is the ratio of the net cash receipts of the project divided by the cash outlays of the project.
- `Break Even Analysis`:
  - BEA finds the amount of time required for the cumulative cash flow from a project to equal its initial and ongoing investment

---

### Operational Feasibility

- **Operational Feasibility**
  - Assessment of how a proposed **system solves business problems** or takes advantage of opportunities

### Technical Feasibility

- **Technical Feasibility**
  - Assessment of the development organization’s **ability to construct** a proposed system

### Schedule Feasibility

- **Schedule Feasibility**
  - Assessment of **time-frame** and **project completion** dates with respect to organization **constraints** for affecting change

### Legal/Contract Feasibility

- **Legal/Contract Feasibility**
  - Assessment of **legal** and **contractual ramifications**of new system

### Political Feasibility

- **Political Feasibility**
  - Assessment of key stakeholders’ view in organization toward proposed system

---

## Baseline Project Plan

- Objectives

  - Assures that **customer** and **development** group have a **complete understanding** of the proposed system and **requirements**
  - Provides sponsoring organization with a clear idea of **scope**, **benefits** and **duration** of project

- **Four Sections** of a Baseline Project Plan:

  - **Introduction**

    - **Brief** overview
    - **Recommended** course of action
    - Project **scope** defined
      - **Units** affected
      - **Interaction** with other systems
      - Range of system **capabilities**
