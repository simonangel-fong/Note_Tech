- So at the beginning of the process, it’s necessary to **have all stakeholders meet** to **formalize the requirements**.

- Gather information on what the system should do **from many sources and from many perspectives**
  - **Users**
  - **Reports**
  - **Forms**

## Interviewing Techniques

- `Interview`:

  - a **method of collecting** information from **stakeholders, users**, or subject matter **experts** through a **structured conversation**, where the goal is to **understand** their **needs**, pain points, and desired **functionalities** to define the requirements for a project or system development;
  - a way to **ask targeted questions** to **gather detailed information** about what a system should do by directly interacting with people who will use it.

- **Talking** to the users to determine what they need is the default technique for most projects.
  - If the person you are talking to is organized and logical in their thought process, it can be relatively easy.
  - However, that’s not always the case, so you will have be employ some formal interviewing **techniques** to gather your requirements.

---

- **Traditional Methods**

  - **Interviewing and Listening**

    - Gather facts, opinions, and speculations
    - **Observe** body language and emotions

---

### Guidelines

- **Plan the interview**
  - Prepare interviewee by making an **appointment** and explaining the purpose of the interview.
  - Prepare a **checklist**, an **agenda**, and **questions**.
- **Be neutral**
  - Avoid asking leading questions.
- **Listen and take notes**

  - Give your undivided **attention** to the interviewee and **take notes** or tape-record the interview (if permission is granted).

- **Review notes**
  - **Review** your notes **within 48 hours** of the meeting.
    - If you discover follow-up questions or need additional information, contact the interviewee.
- **Seek a diverse view(多元视角)**
  - Interview a **wide range of people**, including potential users and managers.

---

### Interview Questions

- **Open-Ended**
  - **No** pre-**specified** answers
  - Used to **probe** for **unanticipated** answers
  - What, who, why
- **Close-Ended**
  - Respondent is **asked to choose **from a set of specified responses
  - Work well when the popular **answers** to questions are **known**
  - Do **not require** a long period of **time**, and can cover a greater number of topics
  - Do you, either or

---

### Techniques

- **Validate** your Understanding:
  - Sometimes if you **restate** what you just heard in the interview, it **helps to validate** that you understood the response correctly.
  - Upon hearing an answer, you might say, “If I understand you correctly….”
- **Paraphrase**:
  - Take a large amount of information you heard and **state it back** to the stakeholder **in your own words**.
  - The stakeholder can then **reaffirm** that you do in fact understand what was said.
- **Stimulate**:
  - Try to get the stakeholder to **stretch a bit** and think about things that are **not obvious**.
  - Ask questions such as, “are there ways you can think of that solve this”?
- **Look for examples**:
  - At times the person doing the interviewing is **not entirely familiar** with the information being gathered so **asking for examples** might make it **clearer** to the interviewer.
  - This would go a long way in making sure the requirements are communicated accurately.
- **Stay on track**:
  - Sometimes the stakeholder **goes off on topics outside the scope** of the interview.
  - This is sometimes the result of a **misunderstood question**.
  - When the discussion goes off track, you might state that they are making a good point, but you could also **ask how that relates to** the original question.

---

### Interview Activity

- Find a partner and conduct an interview with them.
- Find out as much as you can in 10 minutes about their family, childhood, schooling, interests, hobbies, etc., etc.
- Report back the 2 facts that you find the most interesting about the person you have interviewed.

---

## Other means of gathering requirements

- If you don’t know the requirements, it is going to be difficult to build a solution!
- There are many techniques available to gather requirements besides the interview technique.
- Each one has value, but it may take **multiple** techniques to **get a complete picture** of the project requirements.

- A Variety of Techniques
  - One on one interviews
  - Group interviews
  - Facilitated sessions
  - Joint App Development
  - Questionnaires
  - Prototyping
  - Use cases
  - Following people around
  - Requests for proposals
  - Brainstorming

---

### One on One

- The most common technique is to sit down with clients and **ask what they need or want.**
- You need to **plan** the interview **in advance**.
- You want to ask those open **ended questions** in hopes of getting the interviewee to **start talking**.
- Then **uncover the requirements** by asking **probing questions(探究性问题)**.

---

### Group Interviews

- Similar to one on one, but usually **involving three or four**.
- These interviews work well when everyone is **at the same level or has the same role**.
- Usually require **more formality** to get the information you want **from all participants**.
- If you can keep the **group focused**, you will **uncover a richer set of requirements** in a **shorter period** of time.

---

### Facilitated Sessions(引导式会议)

- This is when you bring in **five or more people** trying to **gather** a set of common **requirements** from the group **in a faster manner** than individual interviews.

---

### Joint Application Design (JAD)

- Brings together **key users, managers, and systems analysts**
- Purpose: **collect** system requirements **simultaneously** **from key people**
- They **remain together until** a complete set of **requirements** is **documented** and **agreed upon**.

- Participants

  - Session leader
  - Users
  - Managers
  - Sponsor
  - Systems analysts
  - Scribe
  - IS staff

- End Result
  - Documentation **detailing**
  - **state of the Existing** system
  - **Features** of a **replacement** system

---

### Questionnaires

- Much more **informal** and appropriate for gathering requirements from **stakeholders in remote locations** or even those who **have a minor role** in the overall requirements.
- Good when you have to gather input from **dozens or more people**.

---

### Prototyping

- A modern technique used to **build an initial version of the solution**.
  - You show this to the client, who then **gives you additional requirements**.
- You **change the application and cycle** around with the client again.

  - This repetition continues **until the product meets the business needs** or **until** you have completed a set number of iterations.

- Prototyping

  - **Repetitive** process
  - **Rudimentary version** of system is built
  - **Replaces** or augments `SDLC`
  - Goal:
    - to develop **concrete specifications** for **ultimate** system

- Benefits

  - Quickly **convert** requirements to a **working version of system**
  - Once the user sees **requirements converted** to system, they will **ask for modifications** or will **generate additional** requests

- Most useful when:
  - User requests are **not clear**
  - **Few users** are involved in the system
  - **Designs are complex** and r**equire concrete form to evaluate** fully
  - History of **communication problems** between analysts and users
  - **Tools are readily available** to **build** prototype
- **Drawbacks**
  - Tendency to **avoid formal** documentation
  - Difficult to adapt to **more general user audience**
  - **Sharing data with other systems** is often not considered
  - `Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)` **checks** are often **bypassed**

---

### Use Cases

- `Use Case`
  - a **technique** used in system analysis by **describing how users interact with a system** to achieve a specific goal
  - creating a detailed **story** of how a user would **utilize the system** to complete a task
- `Story telling` describing how discreet processes work.
- These **describe** the solution **from the user perspective.**
- They are easier for the users to articulate.
- Usually have to be **expanded** into **more specific detailed requirements**.

---

### Following people around

- Helpful when gathering information on **existing processes**.
- You may find some people are so entrenched in their work routine, they may have a **difficult time describing** it.
- You can **watch them perform their job** and extrapolate the requirements from their activities.

---

### Direct Observation

- Directly Observing Users
  - Serves as a good method to **supplement interviews**
- Often **difficult** to obtain **unbiased data**
  - People often **work differently** when being observed

---

### Request for proposals

- You may receive a request **as a vendor** for a proposal.
- The **list of requirements** you receive can be **matched against your capabilities** to see how close of a **match** you are **to the needs** of the client.

---

### Brainstorming

- Some requirements may not be uncovered so much as they are discovered.
- The **solution** could be **brand new** and needs to be created as a set of ideas that people can agree upon.
- The appropriate experts meet and start **creatively throwing out ideas** which are then **prioritized**.
- Those ideas are then **voted** on and used for the **initial requirements**.

---

### Analyzing Procedures & Other Docs

- Types of Information to Be Discovered:
  - **Problems** with **existing** system
  - **Opportunity** to meet new need
  - Organizational **direction**
  - Title and names of key individuals
  - **Values** of organization
  - Special **information processing circumstances**
  - Rules for **processing data**

| Chance for follow-up and probing | Good: Opportunity for probing and clarification questions during or after observation      | Limited: Probing possible only if original author is available                                   |
| Confidentiality                  | Observee is known to interviewer; observee may change behavior when observed               | Depends on nature of document; does not change simply by being read                              |
| Involvement of subject           | Interviewees' involvement committed dependent on whether they know they are being observed | None, no clear commitment                                                                        |
| Potential audience               | Limited numbers and limited time of each                                                   | Potentially biased by which documents were kept or because document not created for this purpose |
