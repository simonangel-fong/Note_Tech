### Maintaining

- Process of **returning** to the beginning of the **SDLC** and **repeating development steps** focusing on system **change** until the change is implemented

- Four major activities:
  - Obtaining maintenance **requests**
  - **Transforming** requests into **changes**
  - **Designing** changes
  - **Implementing** changes

---

- **Deliverables and Outcomes**
  - Development of:
    - A **new version** of the **software**
    - **New** versions of all design **documents**
    - **Training materials** created or modified during the maintenance effort

---

### SW Application Testing

- A **test plan** is developed during the **analysis** phase

- During the **design** phase, a `unit test plan` and a `system test plan` are developed

- The actual testing is **done** during **implementation**

- `Test plans` provide improved communication among all parties involved in testing
  - Serve as **checklists**

---

#### Types of Testing

- **Inspection**
  - A testing **technique** in which participants **examine** program **code** for predictable **language-specific errors**
- **Walkthrough**
  - A **peer group review** of any product created during the systems development process; also called a `structured walkthrough`
- **Desk Checking**

  - A testing technique in which the program **code** is sequentially **executed manually** by the **reviewer**

- **Unit Testing**
  - Each **module** is **tested alone** in an attempt to discover any **errors** in its code, also called `module testing`
- **Integration Testing**
  - The process of **bringing together all of the modules** that a **program** comprises for testing purposes; modules are typically integrated **in a top-down, incremental fashion**

---

- **System Testing**
  - The bringing together of **all the programs** that a **system** comprises for testing purposes; programs are typically integrated in a top-down, incremental fashion
- **Systems Integration Testing**
  - The bringing together of **all the systems**/applications that an enterprise system comprises for testing purposes
- **Stub Testing**
  - A technique used in testing, especially where **modules** are written and **tested in a top-down fashion**, where a few lines of code are used to **substitute** for subordinate modules

---

### Testing Process

- The **purpose** of the testing is to **confirm** that the system **satisfies requirements**
- Testing must be **planned**
- `Test Case`
  - A specific **scenario** of transactions, queries, or navigation paths that represent a typical, critical, or **abnormal** **use** of the system
  - Test cases and results should be thoroughly **documented** so they can be repeated for each revision of an application

---

### User Acceptance Testing

- The process whereby **actual users** test a completed information system, the end result of which is the **users’ acceptance** of it
- `Alpha Testing`internal user
  - User testing of a completed information system using **simulated data**
- `Recovery testing`
  - **Forces** the software (or environment) to **fail** in order to **verify** that **recovery** is properly performed
- `Security testing`
  - Verifies that **protection mechanisms** built into the system will **protect** it **from improper penetration**
- `Stress testing`
  - Tries to **break** the system
- `Performance testing`
  - Determines how the system **performs** on the **range of possible environments** in which it may be used

---

- `Alpha Testing`
  - User testing of a completed information system using **simulated data**
- `Beta Testing`
  - User testing of a completed information system using **real data** in the **real user environment**

---

## Installation

- The organizational process of changing over from the current information system to a new one
- Four approaches
  - **Direct** Installation
    - Changing over from the old information system to a new one by **turning off the old system** when the new one is turned on (often called `Big Bang`!)
  - **Parallel** Installation
    - Running the **old** information system and the **new** one **at the same time** until management decides the old system can be turned off

---

- **Single location** installation

  - Trying out an information system **at one site** and using the experience to decide if and how the new system should be deployed throughout the organization (often called a `Pilot`)

- **Phased** Installation
  - Changing from the old information system to the new one **incrementally**, **starting** with one or a **few** functional components and then **gradually extending** the installation to cover the whole new system

---

### Planning Installation

- Considerations
  - **Data conversion**
    - **Error** correction
    - Loading from **current** system
  - Planned system **shutdown**
  - Business **cycle** of organization

---

### System Documentation

- **System** Documentation
  - Detailed information about a system’s **design specifications**, its internal workings, and its **functionality**
- **Internal** documentation
  - System documentation that is part of the **program source code** or is generated **at compile time**
- **External** documentation
  - System documentation that includes the **outcome** of **structured diagramming** techniques such as data-flow and entity-relationship diagrams

---

- **User** Documentation

  - Written, or other visual information, about an application system, how it **works**, and how to **use** it

- **Preparing** User Documentation
  - Traditional source has been information systems department
  - **Application-oriented documentation** is now often supplied by vendors and users themselves

---
