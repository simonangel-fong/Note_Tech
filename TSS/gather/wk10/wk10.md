## BPMN

- `Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)`
  - a standard for **business process modeling** that provides a **graphical notation** for specifying business processes in a `Business Process Diagram (BPD)`.
- `BPMN` is based on a **flowcharting technique** very similar to activity diagrams from the U`nified Modeling Language (UML)`.
- The **objective** of BPMN is to **support business process management**, for both **technical** users and **business** users, by providing a notation that is intuitive to business users, yet able to represent complex process semantics.

`BPMN` has been designed to provide a standard notation readily understandable by all business stakeholders, typically including business analysts, systems analysts, technical developers and business managers. 
BPMN can be used to support the generally desirable aim of all stakeholders on a project adopting a common language to describe processes, helping to avoid communication gaps that can arise between business process design and implementation.
