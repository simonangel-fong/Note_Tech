## The Systems Development Environment

### System and Characteristics

- `system`

  - an interrelated **set of business procedures** used within one business unit working together for a purpose
  - A system exists within an **environment**
  - A **boundary** separates a system from its environment

- **9 characteristics**

  - **Purpose**:
    - The intended **goal** or **objective** that the system is designed to achieve.
  - **Components**:
    - The **individual parts** or elements that make up a system, each **contributing** to its **overall function**.
  - **Interrelated Components**:
    - The way different components within a system are **connected and influence** each other, meaning a change in one component can impact others.
  - **Boundary:**
    - The **line that separates** a system from its external environment, defining what is considered "inside" the system and what is "outside".
  - **Environment**:
    - The **external** factors or conditions that **surround** and potentially **influence** the system.
  - **Interfaces**:
    - The points where a system **interacts with its environment** or other systems, including the methods of communication and data exchange.
  - **Constraints**:
    - **Limitations** or **restrictions** that **affect** the system's design, operation, or capabilities.
  - **Input**:
    - The **data** or information that is **received** by the system from its environment to be **processed**.
  - **Output**:
    - The processed information or results that a system **produces** and **delivers** to its **environment**.

---

### Information system

- **Major goal**:

  - to **improve** organizational systems by developing or acquiring application **software** and **training** employees on its use
  - Application software, or a system, **supports** organizational functions or processes

- **System** components:

  - **Hardware** and system **software**
  - **Documentation** and **training** materials
  - Job **roles** associated with the system
  - **Controls** to prevent theft or fraud
  - The **people** who use the software to perform their jobs

- `Software Engineering Process`
  - A process used to **create an Information System**
  - Consists of:
    - **Methodologies**
      - A **sequence** of step-by-step **approaches** that help develop the information system
    - **Techniques**
      - **Processes** that the analyst follows to ensure thorough, complete, and comprehensive analysis and design
    - Tools
      - Computer **programs** that aid in applying techniques

---

### Sys Analysis & Design

- `Systems Analysis`

  - a proven method to help a business utilize information to its fullest capacity
  - the process of **determining information technology needs** for a particular application and defining solutions for these needs.

---

#### System Analyze Approaches

- `Decomposition`
  - The process of **breaking down** a system into **smaller components**
  -
- Allows the systems analyst to:

  - Break a system into small, **manageable** and **understandable** **subsystems**
  - **Focus** on one area **at a time**, without interference from other areas
  - Concentrate on component pertinent to one group of users without confusing users with unnecessary details
  - **Build** different components at independent times and have the help of different analysts

- `Modularity`
  - Process of **dividing** a system into **modules** of a relatively **uniform size**
  - Modules **simplify** system **design**
- `Coupling`
  - Subsystems that are **dependent upon each other** are coupled
- `Cohesion`

  - Extent to which a subsystem performs a single function 子系统执行单个功能的程度
    高内聚，低耦合

- `Systems Integration`
  - Allows hardware and software from **different vendors** to work together
  - Enables procedural language systems to work with visual programming systems
  - Visual programming environment uses client/server model

---

### Systems Analysts

- `Systems Analysts`
  - an IT professional who primarily **analyzes, designs, and implements information systems** within an organization, essentially **bridging the gap between business needs and technology** by ensuring computer systems function efficiently and meet the company's requirements, including identifying areas for improvement, recommending new applications, and troubleshooting issues that arise with existing systems.
- Key responsibilities

  - Requirements Gathering: Understanding the business needs and identifying specific requirements
  - System Design: Creating detailed system blueprints outlining the architecture
  - Implementation: Overseeing the development
  - Testing and Quality Assurance: ensure the system functions as intended.
  - Maintenance and Support: Monitoring system performance, troubleshooting issues

- `Systems Analysts` perform analysis and design **based** upon: 商业+it

  - **Understanding** of organization’s objectives, structure and processes
  - Knowledge of how to exploit **information technology** for advantage

---

- Role:
  - Study **problems** and **needs** of an organization
  - Determine best **approach** to improving organization through use of:
    - People
    - Methods
    - Information technology
  - Help system users and managers **define their requirements** for new or enhanced information systems

---

- `Systems Development Methodology`
  - A standard process followed in an organization to conduct all the steps necessary to
    - Analyze
    - Design
    - Implement
    - Maintain information systems

---

### Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- `Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)`

  - a **project management model** that describes the **process of creating and maintaining** a system or software.
  - 4 stages:
    - planning, analysis, design, and implementation

- **Planning and Selection**:
  - This phase involves **defining** the project **scope**, identifying **stakeholders**, evaluating **feasibility**, choosing the right development **methodology**, and creating a project **plan**.
  - Identification of **need**
  - Investigation and determination of **scope**
- **Analysis**:
  - the team gathers **detailed requirements** from users, analyzes **existing** systems, and **documents** the functional and non-functional needs of the software.
  - Study of **current** procedures and information systems
  - Determine requirements
  - Generate **alternative** designs
  - **Compare** alternatives
  - **Recommend** best alternative
- **Design:**
  - Based on the analysis, the system **architecture** is developed, including the components, interfaces, data flow, and system design details.
  - **Logical Design**
    - Concentrates on business aspects of the system
  - **Physical Design**
    - Technical specifications
- **Implementation and Operation**:
  - This phase involves **coding** the software according to the design, **testing** the functionalities, **deploying** the system to the production environment, and providing ongoing support and **maintenance**.

---

- Phases are **not** necessarily **sequential**
- Each phase has a specific **outcome** and **deliverable**
- Every company **customizes** the life-cycle model to its individual needs

---

### Alternative Approach

### Prototyping

- `Prototyping`
  - Building a **scaled-down working version** of the system
- **Advantages**:
  - **Users are involved** in design
  - Captures **requirements** in concrete form
- `Computer-Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) Tools`

  - computer programs that help with software development tasks.
  - **Automated software tools** used by systems analysts to develop information systems
  - Can be used throughout SDLC
  - Product and tool integration is provided through a repository

- General types of CASE tools
  - Diagramming tools
    - e.g., Draw.io: A web-based tool for diagramming
  - Analysis tools
  - Computer display and report generators
  - Documentation generators
  - Code generators
  - Repository

---

#### JAD

- `Joint Application Design (JAD)`
  - Users, Managers & Analysts **work together** for several days
  - System requirements are reviewed
  - Structured meetings

---

#### RAD

- `Rapid Application Development (RAD)`
  - Utilizes **prototyping** to **delay** producing system design until after user requirements are clear

---

#### Participatory Design (PD)

- `Participatory Design (PD)`
  - Emphasizes **role of the user**
  - Entire **user community** can be involved in design

---

#### Agile Methodologies

- Focuses on
  - **Adaptive** methodologies
  - People instead of roles
  - Self-adaptive development process
