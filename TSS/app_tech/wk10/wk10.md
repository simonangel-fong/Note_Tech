## IaC

### Typical Deploying, Maintaining, and Testing

- What are the **typical steps** involved in **configuring** a server and **deploying** an application on it?

  - Install **OS** and **packages**
  - Configure **networking** and **security**
  - Install the **application** itself
  - **Configure** the application
  - Add supporting **infrastructure**
    - monitoring/logging, schedule periodic maintenance jobs, backups

---

- After initial setup, the application and its environment need to be **maintained**
  - Update application **version**
  - Update application **dependencies**
  - Redeploy to a different **server**, or install on a different OS

---

- In addition to production environments, your developers want **testing** and development environments to work in
  - **Replicate** the same process of setup and maintenance of application **environment**
  - Enable running of application’s **unit/integration tests**, but also test the above steps as well
    - A **failing** backup or a DB library update that crashes the application is every bit as problematic as a bug in application software code itself

---

### Infrastructure as Code

- All above tasks are accomplished using some type of ”code”:
  - **Scripts** for deploying and setting up application environment
  - **Configuration files** that define application and system settings
- Develop and maintain this code like you do your application’s code
- Use `version control` to develop it over time as a team
- Test it using unit and integration tests
- Deploy in production once it is ready

---

- IaC Tools

- You can **treat your infrastructure as code** by simply using `VCS` on a set of bash scripts
- Many tools exist to make this process easier and quicker
  - Provide commonly used functionality out of the box
  - Creating an environment for reusing code
    - Wrapping shared functionality into **modules**
      - E.g. Configure MySQL DB
    - Writing **reusable recipes/playbooks**
      - E.g. Restore DB on a MySQL DB to a given snapshot
- Working out of the box with deployment platforms
  - Deploy to Kubernetes

---

- IaC concepts

- **Declarative** vs **procedural** configuration
  - Define **desired state** like a config file (`Terraform`)
  - Provide step by step **instructions** on how to get there (`Ansible`)
- Update by **reconfiguring** vs **replacing**
  - A more **conventional approach** of treating deployed services like normal computers which you reconfigure in place (`Ansible`)
  - Treating them as **immutable** and **replacing** them with newer versions (`Terraform`)
- How is the configuration performed?
  - Install an **agent process** which communicates with master serve to receive configuration changes (`Puppet`)
  - **Package** any necessary **commands**, push them to target machine/container using e.g. SSH, run remotely, clean up (`Ansible`)

```hcl
provider mycloud {
  # Configuration for your provider
}

resource mycloud_instance example {
  name        = example-instance
  image_id    = ubuntu-20.04
  instance_type = t2.micro

  network_interface {
    network = default
    address = 10.0.0.1
  }
  tags = {
    Name = example-instance
  }
}
```

```yaml
- name: Set up an example VM
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure the VM is created
      mycloud_instance:
        name: example-instance
        image_id: ubuntu-20.04
        instance_type: t2.micro
        network:
          name: default
          address: 10.0.0.1
      tags:
        Name: example-instance
    - name: Set up networking
      mycloud_network:
        network: default
        address: 10.0.0.1
    - name: Apply tags
      mycloud_tag:
        resource: example-instance
        tags:
          Name: example-instance

```

### Ansible

- **Agentless** & **procedural** configuration management
- Execute tasks from **control machine** to **remotely** manage, configure/reconfigure servers
- The **base unit** of Ansible is a **module**, which executes a well-defined **small task** and accepts **arguments**
  - E.g. `ansible.builtin.copy` module – **Copy** files to remote locations
- These tasks are typically **multi-platform** and flexible (see copy or git)
- A large collection of **built-in modules** are provided
- Can write **custom modules** or obtain third-party modules from community
  - E.g. `Kubernetes` service module

---

#### Ansible Playbooks

- Combining modules together in **sequences** to accomplish more complex tasks
- Defines a **sequence of tasks** (description, module and arguments)

---

#### Hosts & variables

- Need to define **hosts** on which **playbooks will be executed**
- Define and use **variables** in playbooks to avoid repetition
- Altogether defines a **play**.
- **Multiple plays** may be present in a `playbook`

```yaml
- name: Simple Ansible Playbook
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  vars:
    custom_message: "Welcome to my website!"
  tasks:
…
    - name: Create a custom index.html
      copy:
        content: "{{ custom_message }}"
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
```

---

### Inventory

- Define **hosts** and group them together into groups in **inventory**
- Also used to define **variables** that are applicable to specific hosts or groups

```yaml
all:
  vars:
    global_var_1: value
  children:
    db_servers:
      vars:
        db_port: 5432
      hosts:
        web_app_db:
          ansible_host: webapp.local
        metrics_db:
          ansible_host: metrics.local
    web_servers:
      vars:
        app_type: django
      hosts:
        customer_app:
        monitoring_app:
        login_app:
```

---

### Ansible concepts

- **Complex tasks** can be organized together into **roles** and **collections**
- `Roles` group together playbooks, variables, files, templates, etc.
- `Collections` group together roles, playbooks, modules, etc.

- `Ansible` can be used to **deploy a service** to a **physical server** (e.g. container host), a Docker container, a different type of **container**
  - If the end result is a **Docker image**, `Ansible playbook` can be thought of as an alternative to using a **Dockerfile**

---

### Ansible testing

- Just like you would test application code with **unit testing** framework, there is a **framework** for writing unit and integration tests for `Ansible` playbooks and roles
- Linters for checking valid YAML syntax and `Ansible` syntax (yamllint & ansible-lint)
- `Molecule` is a **testing framework** that allows you to **create a test environment** (e.g. using Docker images) and verify that your role or playbook runs successfully on it

---

- Create **scenarios** to set up a testing environment
- Define one or more **containers** to test a playbook or role
- Create **playbooks** for
  - Setting up the **test environment** (plays that only happen during testing)
  - Actually running the **code** you’re testing
  - Running some **tests** to ensure it functions properly
- `Molecule scenarios` can be run in a **CI/CD pipeline**

---

## Software testing

- `Testing`
  - an integral part of the **software development process**
- `Functional testing` evaluates whether software works as intended, **verifies accuracy of actions and results**

  - Focus on two **fundamental** types of `functional testing`
    - **Unit** testing
    - **Integration** testing

- `Non-functional testing` focuses on aspects of **quality** beyond its intended function/logic

  - Scalability, performance under stress, etc.

- How are they written, how are they run and how do they fit into the development workflow?

---

### Unit Testing

- `Unit testing` verifies **functionality** of individual **units** and **components**, in isolation
- This is the “first line of defence” when it comes to testing the software system, and **most** tests **should** be written as `unit tests`
- Software development process that results in small, independent components makes it easier to write good unit tests

```py

class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b

    def divide(self, a, b):
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError(Cannot divide by zero!)
        return a / b


class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.calculator = Calculator()

    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calculator.add(1, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(self.calculator.add(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(self.calculator.add(-1, -1), -2)

```

---

### Test Coverage

- How well do the unit tests verify the functionality of your component?
- One important **metric** is to consider all possible ways your code can be executed and see whether the unit tests cover that
- `Line coverage`
  - has **each line been reached** by at least one unit test?
- `Branch coverage`
  - for **branching statements** such as if statements, have **all branches** been executed?
- `Condition coverage`:
  - has each (boolean) **condition** been evaluated as True/False?

```js
int foo (int x, int y)
{
    int z = 0;
    if ((x > 0) && (y > 0))
    {
        z = x;
    }
    return z;
}
```

- **Statement coverage**: `foo(1,1)==1`
- **Branch coverage**: foo(1,1)==1, foo(0,1)==0
- **Condition coverage**: foo(1,1)==1, foo(0,1)==0, foo(1,0)==0

---

### Integration Testing

- Having tested components **independently of each other** with `unit testing`, you also need to verify that components **interact with each other** as intended
- Verify **compatibility** of APIs, correct data transfer between components, etc.
- A lot of **high-level functional requirements** will map onto `integration tests`
- Approaches in writing

---

#### workflow

- **Identify** components
  - which have been unit-tested internally
- Create a test **plan**
  - Identify `test scenarios` and `test cases`
- Set up test **environment**
  - An environment that closely **mirrors** **production** environment
  - If components are separated into services that communicate over the network, using **containerized** test environments is very helpful
- **Execute** the tests
- **Analyse** results and **fix** problems

---

### Manual, Automated and Continuous

- All developers perform `ad-hoc manual testing` when they debug an issue, explore how their code runs in practice by stepping through it, etc.
- `Automating` such tests involves **up-front work** in setting up the test **environment** and writing the **tests as code**
- The **goal** is to ensure the problem is **only fixed once** and new features don’t add regressions
- When `automating tests` is not feasible (e.g. too difficult to set up test environment to test web UI components in the browser), some tests may be performed **manually as last resort**

---

- Automatic testing allows you to run tests by executing a program
  - `cd project-directory/tests && pytest .`
- `Continuous testing` is about **integrating** the `unit` and `integration tests` into your design and build workflow
- The most fundamental way to ensure your tests are always run is to **trigger them automatically** at important milestones
  - Every time you **push** code to a remote repository
  - Every time you **merge** a feature into your main branch

---

- `Continuous Integration`
  - A practice of **automating the integration of changes** into a software project
- Enables **multiple contributors** to simultaneously work on features and merge them independently without having to worry about regressions
- **Relies** heavily on well-written `unit tests` that provide proper coverage
- Used in **Agile** Software Development workflow

---

### Continuous Deployment

- **Automatic packaging** and **delivery** of software to end users
- **Triggers** various steps on pre-defined checkpoints, such as merging a branch into the main branch, or daily builds:
  - **Compiling** source code into binary executables or libraries
  - **Packaging** code and **uploading** to repositories (e.g. uploading python module to PyPI)
  - **Building** a container **image**
  - **Deploying** a web application in production
- Since these steps are often required to run before testing, a combined `CI/CD pipeline` performs both building/packaging and testing of software

---

### CI/CD Pipelines

- There are standalone **cloud services** that provide CI/CD capability
  - E.g. AppVeyor for Windows
- Others are integrated into developer/`VCS` platforms
  - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
- Allow **automatic testing** and deployment on **multiple platforms** (OS, instruction set), multiple versions, etc.
  - Intractable and far less useful unless fully automated and continuously run

---

### Development Workflow

- Integrating `unit testing` and `CI/CD` into a project’s development workflow heavily influences every part of the development process
  - E.g. the process of dealing with bugs or **issues**:
    1. **Document the issue** in your issue tracker, **discuss** it with colleagues
    2. Work on a **fix**:
       1. Start by writing a `unit test`, run it and ensure it fails.
       2. Write the **fix** itself, and ensure the unit test from previous step now passes
    3. **Commit** to a branch and **push** to VCS server (e.g. GitHub)
    4. Make a **Merge** Request
    5. CI/CD pipeline **runs**, ensuring **all tests** and **build/packaging** steps are not broken
    6. Discuss fix with others and merge
