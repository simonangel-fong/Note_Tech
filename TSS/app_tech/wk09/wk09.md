What is an API?
Common API types
RPC, SOAP, REST, GraphQL
APIs in enterprise environment

## Application Programming Interface

- `APIs`

  - methods for software components or systems to **communicate** using agreed-upon **interface**

- ``API Specification`

  - a document or standard **defining** this interface

- A system or component implements an API
- Applications or components can **communicate** locally using APIs
  - **Local system APIs** for
    - e.g. process management
  - **Inter-Process Communication**
    - **sharing memory** objects, message queues
- **Network based APIs** use `HTTPS` to securely communicate between client and server

---

### API calls

- The common procedure for making an API call:
  - **Client**:
    - **Serialize** client data/object into an **API-specific format**
    - **Send** data over the network to an API endpoint
  - **Server**:
    - **Deserialize** received data into data/object understood by the server

---

### Remote Procedure Call

- Implemented on **both** client and server as **dedicated components** called `stubs`
  - Client calls `client stub`
    - i.e. a function call
- 1. `Client stub` **serializes** (packs) data into a message and makes a system call to **send** message to server
- 2. Client’s **OS** **sends** a message to Server’s OS
- 3. Server’s **OS** **passes** message to `Server stub`
- 4. `Server stub` **deserializes** (unpacks) message into data
- 5. `Server stub` **calls** server **procedure/function**
- When data is to be sent back, client and server reverse roles

---

### SOAP

- `Remote Procedure Call (RPC)`

  - a software communication **protocol** that one program uses to **request a service** from another program located on a different computer and network, without having to understand the network's details.

- `XML-RPC`

  - A particular type of RPC emerged that used **standardized format for its messages (XML)** and used **HTTP** as network transport mechanism
  - XML + HTTP

- `SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)`

  - a messaging **protocol** that uses `XML` to **exchange structured information** between applications, often used in enterprise systems for reliable and secure communication, and is a standard for building web services.

- an **extension** of `XML-RPC` to create a general, standardized and well-defined **application interface** suitable for enterprise use

---

- features

  - More **rigidly defined** XML messages
  - Message **schemas/types** (i.e. structure of the XML message)
  - **Requirements** for applications that receive message (can be used in e.g. routing of messages)
  - Message **chaining** (e.g. this is first message in a **series**)
  - Security/encryption

- Example

  - SOAP **exposes functions or operations** that can be performed within an application or service
  - e.g. there’s a **CreateEmployee function** that takes a message CreateEmployeeRequest with employee details
  - It provides a response message of type CreateEmployeeResponse

---

- The approach of SOAP is to allow detailed **up-front definition** of everything about how the message is **structured** and **processed**
- Useful for environments that **value detailed records of transactions** over simplicity and performance
- Bank transaction, flight booking
- Tight **coupling between client and server**

---

### REST

- `Representational State Transfer (REST)`
  - a software **architectural style** for designing web services and APIs, emphasizing **stateless communication**, uniform **interfaces**, and client-server interaction, making systems more scalable and maintainable
- Centers around **resources/data** rather than functions
- Primarily uses `HTTP` as its application layer protocol, and four HTTP resource access methods become the **methods** of manipulating resources:
  - `GET`
    - **retrieving** the resource
  - `PUT`:
    - **modifying** the resource
  - `POST`:
    - **creating** the resource
  - `DELETE`:
    - **deleting** the resource

---

#### HTTP request

- **Request line** defines

  - **method**
  - **URL** defining the **resource** being accessed
  - and **protocol** version

- **Header fields**
  - provide the **context** of the message,
  - e.g. host, directives about caching, interpreting the body
- **Message body**

  - containing **data** associated with the message

- `SOAP` is often used over `HTTP`, and its resource would be a service,
  - e.g. for employee creation request:

---

#### REST message

- `RESTful APIs` make use of **standard** `HTTP` methods to provide a CRUD interface to the data

  - Create,
  - Read,
  - Update,
  - Delete

- REST (HTTP) **header** contains the **context**
- REST (HTTP) **body** contains **data** that accompanies the message
- Headers have information such as
  - **Type of data** stored in the message (e.g. JSON, XML)
  - **Security context** (e.g. authentication using tokens)
  - **Processing directives**

---

#### HTTP/REST response

- HTTP defines **response messages**, which are also used by REST APIs
- Responses will have a **status** code and a **body**
- A code is a standardized and generic **response** to accessing/manipulating resources, e.g.:
  - `200`: OK
  - `201`: Created
  - `204`: often used for confirm a successful modify
  - `404`: not found
  - `500`: server error
- Response **body** provides **more context**
  - e.g. GET response body will have the data being requested

---

- Example
  - REST is centered around **data or resources**, so it exposes a **URL** called /employees.
  - You interact with it using the four operations. **Creating** an employee means issuing a **POST** call to this endpoint:

---

#### REST principles

- RESTful constraints define a software design architecture for **distributed** web applications, with these key principles:
  - **Clients and servers** are **separated** by a well-defined and uniform **interface** which is not specific to implementation
  - A layered system: client **cannot** tell whether it’s connected to the server **directly** or through **intermediaries**
  - **Stateless**: every request is **treated as new**. Any context or state is passed by the client in the REST request itself.

---

- REST APIs
  - REST is more **lightweight** and flexible, and thus **easier to use** in web-based applications
  - Uniform and **less rigidly** defined interface makes REST APIs more **flexible**.
    - It is easier to swap out components that expose a REST API without affecting components that connect to it.
  - **Message sizes** are **smaller** and messages are more amenable to caching.
- However, REST APIs can be **“chatty”** – **breaking up** complex operations into a series of simple REST API calls **adds overhead**

---

#### Sessions and REST

- `Sessions` maintain **state information** across multiple interactions between a server and a client
  - **Authentication/authorization**, **custom** web app settings that were set on a client and should **persist** next time they visit, etc.
- **Server** stores information about a client and **identifies it by session ID**, which client sends with each request
- `Cookies` are a way for server to **store small blocks of data on the client**.
  - They can be used to **store session info**.

---

### GraphQL

- `GraphQL`

  - a strongly typed API architecture, which means that it requires a **detailed description** of the data, its **structure**, and data **operations** in the schema.

- Another API approach is to **create a “query language”** for data/resources under an application’s purview
- **Resources** and **relationships** between them are **codified in schema**
  - This allows to create **complex queries** that interact with different resources and provide a response in one go
    - E.g. list employee names and last login date (but nothing else) in department A who are registered as users of application B
- Would necessitate **multiple** REST calls
- Analogous to how SQL provides a query language to a relational database

---

- Compared to REST, `GraphQL` is **more time consuming** to create and modify, primarily because of **schema creation**
- Makes sense to **optimize interactions** with complex and applications
- For simple and small applications, REST is typically enough

---

### Service Oriented Architecture

- Creating and maintaining APIs is a major part of the task of **breaking up** monolithic applications into **loosely coupled services**
- A REST API is the typical way to integrate web applications both within and between organizations
- Client-side components of a many typical web applications interact with server-side components using REST APIs
- Other API types, such as `SOAP` and `GraphQL`, provide alternatives for enterprise applications for complex/resource intensive queries, or very standardized/contract-like interactions

---

### API Gateway

- A separate service that serves as an **entry point to a multi-service application**
- Manages API **access** to other services and provides a common interface to them
- Performs **load balancing**, **rate limiting**, **monitoring**, **security** and **scaling**
- Can be used to provide **uniform interface** (e.g. REST) to services that expose different types of APIs (e.g. REST, SOAP)
- Can be **standalone** or **built into** tools like Kubernetes or AWS

---

Version control
Applicability
Git and distributed version control
Internal structure
Committing, branching and merging
Collaboration
Version Control Systems/Servers

## Version Control System

- **Tracking the history** of a set of files, often source code
- Each version **records** the contents, changes, dates, comments and other context
- Enables multiple authors to **collaborate** on the same set of files

---

- `Version control systems` range from simple (linear history) to complex (branching/merges)
- Can be embedded into other tools **as a feature** (e.g. versioning in Google Docs)
- A stand-alone `VCS` provides tooling and workflows for **managing** changes, **resolving** conflicts and **syncing** with centralized servers or collaborators

---

### Diffing (comparing) text files

- `Version control systems` rely on tools that **compare** files and create a summary of changes (diff or patch)
- This diff/patch can be **stored** by VCS, and applied to version N-1 to produce **version** N
- Different algorithms/strategies to **minimize**/localize patches of complex files

---

### File types

- VCS is often used on **text-based files**
  - such as source code, scripts, configuration files, etc.
- Differences/patches are **stored** **from version to version**, allowing for efficient storage of the entire history
- **Non-text files** are more **difficult** to deal with and require special handling or different VCS
  - **Text-based** VCS typically store **new copies of binary files** such as executables or images with each version
  - Some document formats such as `DOCX` (Microsoft Office) are stored in a way that makes it **useless to track changes** to them as if they were simple text files
    - E.g. each time Word saves a copy, it shuffles file contents, making text-based diff useless

---

### Versioning source files

- **Versioning** a software project usually implies **tracking** files manually written by developers, i.e. source code, setup scripts, configuration files, etc.
- **Ignoring** any **derivative** files
  - Files that are produced by a tool during the development or building process
  - Storing in them in VCS leads to **bloat**
  - Store **scripts** or documentation on how to generate them instead
- A `VCS repository` is the **collection** of all **tracked files** and their **directory structure**, as well as all the **versions**

---

### Distributed VCS with Git

- Originally developed for distributed (de-centralized) project collaboration
- Linux Kernel development involves hundreds of developers making changes to source code independently, discussing on mailing list and then merging
- Designed for performance, being able to handle large codebases and complex history

---

- Users **clone** their own complete repository, optionally **syncing** it with other copies via **pushing** and **pulling** versions and **reconciling** the version history

---

### Commits and hashing

- `Git` is organized around **commits**: objects that store all information about a particular version of the tracked files
  - **File** contents and **directory** structure
  - **Timestamp**
  - **Log** message explaining the change
  - **References** to zero or more parent commits
- Objects in git (such as commits) are stored and **referenced** by their **hash**
- **Hashing** is a way to quickly and compute a **fixed-length value**

- Example

```sh

---

#### Commit workflow

- **Check out** a version of your project files
- When ready to commit:
  - **Stage** files with changes, or new files, to the **staging area**
    - Can stage **all** changes, or a **subset** that logically fits together
  - **Review** changes
  - Create a **commit** with a commit **message**

---

#### Branches and tags

- Commits contain zero or more **parents**, so your version history consists of **a chain of commits**
- Commits can be **referred** to by their **hash**, or given a label called **tag**
- **Currently** checked out commit has the **`HEAD` tag**

---

- **Branches** are used to **switch** between **different version** of code and develop them **in parallel**
- There is usually a **main** or **master** branch
- You can **branch off** to work on a **feature**, then switch back to master to work on a different task

```sh
git branch iss53
git checkout iss53

(modify some files)
(stage them for commit)
git commit –m ”fixed issue #53”

git checkout master
git checkout –b hotfix
(…make changes and commit them)
```

---

### Basic Merging

```sh
git checkout master
git merge iss53
```

---

#### Merge conflicts

- Straightforward merges are handled **automatically** by git
  - “Merge strategies”
- **Conflicting** changes **cannot** be merged automatically so your intervention is required
  - e.g. if commit C4 (branch hotfix) and commit C5 (branch iss52) both change the same line of code in different ways
- The basic workflow is to:
  - **initiate** the merge
  - **deal with** conflicts (**manually** but with git’s help)
  - **continue** the **merge**

---

### Rebasing

- Instead of **merging two** divergent branches and **preserving** the branching-off, you can **apply** **commits of one branch** on top of another

---

### Remotes

- Git can manage **synchronization with remote** repositories
- Although originally developed with **decentralization** in mind, the typical workflow now consists of **cloning** from a central repository on a git server
- Git **tracks** one or more remotes with which it can interact by **fetching** or **pulling** changes from them and **pushing** changes to them
- Synced remote branches can now be **reconciled** with local branches by **merging and/or rebasing**

---

### Collaboration workflows and practices

- Different teams **settle on different workflows** and management practices when using git
  - Do you merge or do you rebase
  - Do you keep a single ”master” branch, or release/fixes branch
- `Trunk-based development` is a management practice where developers **merge small and frequent updates** to a main branch (trunk)
- Other approaches create more elaborate sets of **long-lived branches**

---

### Best practices

- **Adhere to the workflow agreed** on by your team
- Write **meaningful commit messages** describing the **change** and documenting any non-obvious **details**
- Use git **during development** to **track progress**
  - e.g. quickly commit work in progress before moving on to other projects
    - `git commit –a –m “in progress, not compiling yet”`
- then **re-write commits** when ready to send them to your collaborators
  - E.g. use interactive merge to reorder, split and combine commits, writing informative commit messages for your co-workers (and yourself later on)

---

### VCS servers / development platforms

- `Version Control System` (Git server) provides a **core** functionality for a service
  - A **central repository** of all your code, with user access control, proper storage, etc.
- Integrating other **features** transforms this into a development platform
  - Issue **tracking**
  - **CI/CD** pipelines (next slide deck)
  - Wikis and **discussions**
  - Project/Task **management** tools
  - **Milestones**, issue boards, etc.
