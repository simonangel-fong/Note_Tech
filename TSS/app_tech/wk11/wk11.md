---

### Integrity & Ethics

- **Ethics**
  - a **consistent set** of **principles and values** **guiding** decisions and behaviour
- Honesty, truthfulness, consistency
- The most difficult concept to adhere to is **consistency**
- In addition to personal ethics, codes of ethical behaviour arise in organizations
- A **set of principles** that guide an organization in achieving its goals

---

#### Organizational Ethics

- Ethics in an **organization** can be deliberately **designed** and **enforced**, or **arise** naturally
- **Ethical values and principles** vary by culture, and this includes quasi-cultures that develop in the workplace
- In order to be proactive and guide their employees toward a consistent set of ethical behaviours, organizations develop `codes of ethics`.

---

### Laws

- `Laws` that govern certain aspects of your work must be understood and followed
- All employees must be **familiarized** with laws and regulations that apply to their work
- `Legal liability`
  - conduct that organizations, and sometimes their employees, can be sued for
- Developing `codes of conduct`, training, creating the right incentives, behaving proactively - all limits legal liability
- `Whistleblowing protections` exist for **reporting illegal** behaviour

---

#### Canadian Legislation

- `PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act)` and `Digital Privacy Act`
  - **Governs** how **private** sector organizations collect, use, and disclose **personal information**
  - Requires organizations to **obtain consent** for the collection of **personal data**
  - **Mandates** that personal information must be protected **by appropriate security safeguards**
  - Organizations must **report** data **breaches** that pose a significant **risk of harm** to individuals
  - Requires **keeping records** of all data breaches

---

- `FIPPA - Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act`
  - Applies to **provincial government institutions** and governs the **access** to information and protection of **personal privacy**
  - Grants individuals the **right to access records** held by **provincial institutions**
  - Mandates the **protection** of personal information and the **prevention** of unauthorized access

---

  - Establishes **procedures** for the **disclosure** of wrongdoing and the **investigation** of complaints

---

## Code of Ethics

- How to **make decisions** and how to **behave** in ethically **questionable situations**
  - E.g. data breaches, product recalls
- Defines a **guiding principle** of what **organization strives** to be
  - fair to its customers & employees
  - collaborative with their community on issues such as the environment
- Specifies **rules** and **guidelines** for **employees to follow**
- Sets **clear expectations** for employees
- Spells out **consequences** of misconduct

---

- `Code of conduct` in the workplace may **include** but not limited to:
  - **Alcohol**/substance use
  - **Theft** & Fraud
  - Human **rights**, **Accessibility**, **Diversity**. **Inclusion**, Preventing **violence** in the workplace
  - Protecting the company **assets** – Intellectual, physical, trademarks
  - Work Environment
    - **Appearance**/courtesy
    - **Health** & Safety
    - **Physical** Security

- Avoid **harm**
- Be **honest** and **trustworthy**
- Be **fair** and take **action not** to **discriminate**

---

### Ethics Training

- When you have a code of ethics and setting expectations for employees you have to **provide training** to them
  - In class, online, employee orientation
- **Explain** the code of ethical conduct and **how to follow** it in this specific organization
- How to handle **bids** on work from external partners and contractors
- **Conflicts of interest**, gifts
- Acceptable **use** of **electronic** communication
- **Sensitive information** handling, employee and customer privacy

---

### Why develop a Code of Ethics

- Organizations develop codes of ethics and conduct to **avoid negative consequences** of **unethical** and **illegal** behaviour by employees
- If **expectations** were spelled out, and resources devoted to encouraging ethical behaviour, this can **limit legal liability**
  - **Training**, **investment** in security/privacy, good hiring **practices**, **whistleblower** protections, etc
- Ethical deeds (not just words) make for more **loyal** employees and customers

---

### Acceptable Use Policy

- “A set of **rules** applied by the **owner, creator, possessor or administrator** of a computer network, website, or service that **restricts the ways** in which the network, website or system may be used and sets **guidelines as to how** it should **be used**”
- Companies put together `AUPs` to set clear **expectations** for customers and employees about use of their resources
- **Standards** for communications, what constitutes **misuse**, reporting misuse, etc.
- `Compliance` is often measured by **audits**

---

- Incentives
  - A good way to think about ethics and legal issues in the workplace is by **examining incentives**
  - Corporations have **incentives** to **deliver value** to their owners – **profits**
  - Customers who gravitate towards **ethical** companies and value **reputation** provide **incentives** for companies to behave ethically
  - Ensuring ethical behaviour involves setting up the **right incentives for employees**, e.g. by not penalizing reports of misconduct
  - **Conflicting incentives** in play when dealing with e.g. data breaches, or product recalls
  - **Unethical** behaviour can arise from **excessive pressures to perform**
    - E.g. sales commissions

---

### Ethical Issues in IT

- IT professionals often have **access** to a lot of very **sensitive information**
  - Private health, financial, educational information
- Ethical/legal **duty** to ensure **appropriate use and access** to this data
  - **Not** deliberately **accessing** information of other users and customers
  - **Minimizing risk** of inappropriate **disclosure** – whether through breaches or carelessness
- Potential for **harmful actions** for company or customers
  - **Loss** of important data, loss of property, loss of income, etc.
  - Mr Bates vs the Post Office
    - British Post Office scandal is a textbook case of harm that negligence in a large IT organization can do in the real world

---

- **Surveillance** of colleagues
  - Right to **privacy**
  - Employee expectations of acceptable **use** of their **resources**
- Access to **trade secrets**
  - often **beyond** what’s **needed** for your **job responsibilities**
- Bribe or Gift?
  - Questionable **practices** when dealing with e.g. contractor **bids**
  - **Paid-for conferences and retreats** – bribe or gift?
  - Is there **expectation of returning** the favour?
- **International** vendors and customers in **areas** where bribery is **commonplace**

---

- **Whistleblowing** – what happens when **laws**, **ethics** and company policies are in **conflict**?
  - Laws and **protections** exist
  - What if what’s legal, or claimed to be legal, is unethical or illegal?
  - **Consequences** – rightly or wrongly – can include loss of employment, legal problems, prison, or being called a traitor
- **Resume and credentials** inflation
  - Clearly unethical and can lead to **termination** even if you perform well
  - Thinking back to incentives – why does this happen? Do employers share some blame?

---

## Intellectual Property

- Products of **mental labour** (idea, invention, process) that are created by a person or a group and distinct from already existing ones
- Protections exist to protect **a distinct expression or implementation of an idea**, but **not an idea itself**
  - e.g. a proprietary file transfer protocol, not the idea of network file transfer
- **Owners** have rights to their IP, and can share, **licence** or **prohibit** the use of their IP by others
- Different countries interpret the concept of IP **differently**, but **international agreements** exist to protect IP worldwide

---

### IP balancing act

- **Protection** of `intellectual property` is important because it gives people an **incentive** to be **creative**
- Gives an organization an **incentive** to **research** and **develop** novel processes and products
- **Innovators** with great **ideas** will be more likely to **pursue** those ideas if they have a clear understanding of how they will **benefit**
- However, **excessive IP protection** (too broad, too long) can **inhibit innovation** and **reduce competition**
- Governments balance these **priorities** by creating laws and rules around IP, **fair use**, time limits, etc.

---

### Copyright

- **Protection** given to songs, books, computer software and other **creative work** that has an **author** or **authors**
- Under the terms of copyright, the **author** of a work **controls** what can be done with the work, including production of copies, derivative works, performances/displays, distribution, licensing
- **Methods of expressing ideas**, not ideas themselves
- **Threshold** for what can be `copyrighted` is **lower** than for `patents`, i.e. does not have to be novel
- Creative arrangements/expressions of ideas, regardless of how much work was applied
- Lasts for a **limited of time**, after which it **enters public domain**

---

### Copyright Protection & Infringement

- The **consequences** of **infringing** the copyright law can be **civil** or **criminal**, and are set out in the copyright legislation
  - For example, a civil court may decide that money be paid as compensation for damages caused by unauthorized use of a copyright work
- Software, websites and apps can be **protected** via **copyright**
- **Lower threshold** to obtain protection, **lower cost**
- More **limited protection**
  - **expression of idea**, not idea itself.
  - Making a **replica from scratch** is **not** copying

---

- The legal **penalties** for copyright infringement are:
  - Infringer pays the actual dollar amount of **damages** and **profits**.
  - The law provides a range from **$200 to $150,000** for each work infringed.
  - Infringer pays for all **attorney’s fees** and **court costs**.
  - The Court can issue an injunction to **stop the infringing acts.**
  - The Court can **impound** the illegal works.
  - The infringer can go to **jail**.

---

### Patents

- Patents apply to **inventions**. An invention is **eligible** for **patent protection** if it is:

  - **new** - first in the world
  - **useful** - functional and operative
  - **inventive** - showing ingenuity and not obvious to someone of average skill who works in the field of your invention

- The **invention** must also be:

  - a **product** (example: a door lock)
  - a **composition** (example: a chemical composition used in lubricants for door locks)
  - a **machine** (example: a machine for making door locks)
  - a **process** (example: a method for making door locks)
  - an **improvement** on any of these

---

- Useful man-made **ideas**, **not** natural **phenomena**
- Time **limited**, like copyright
- Protection granted in exchange for **public release** of invention **details**
- Much **higher threshold** for granting a patent
  - application to **patent office**, approval process, more **stringent novelty criteria**
  - **Exhausive search** for prior art to ensure the patent is for novel, unpatented idea
- More comprehensive protection
  - **copying**, **reproduction**
  - even independently produced **replicas** are covered

---

- `Software patents` protect a **novel system**, **not** **code** itself
- Feature, design or process
- Patent **holder** is **responsible** for **enforcing/policing** their own patents
- **Complex** set of rules for what **constitutes infringement**
- Companies sometimes **aggressively police** their patents and engage in patents **“arms races”** with competitors
- `Cross-licencing` is often used to “exchange” use of your patent for that of your competitor

---

### Trademarks

- “A combination of letters, words, sounds or designs that **distinguishes one company’s goods or services from** those of others in the marketplace.”
- Unique and important to the company due to association with its **reputation** and **brand**
- **Registering** a trademark protects it from misuse and **grants exclusive rights** as long as it is **in use**
- Trademark holders have the **right** to e.g. Internet **domain name** registration

---

### Trade Secrets

- **Private/confidential business information** that has **value**, takes time/**resources** to **develop** and is unique or novel in some way
- **“Formulas**, **practices**, **processes**, **designs**, instruments, patterns, or compilations of information that have inherent economic value because they are **not generally known** or readily ascertainable by others, and which the **owner takes reasonable measures** to keep secret”
- `Trade secrets` = no **application**, time **limit**, **disclosure**. 
  - But **limited protection**, too, once the secret is out
- **Employees** may be bound by legal terms about not divulging trade secrets, within reason – non-compete or non-disclosure agreements

---

### Personally Identifiable Information

- Information about a **person** that can be used to **uniquely establish that person’s identify** is called `personally identifiable information, or PII`. This is a broad category that includes information such as:
  - name;
  - social security number;
  - date of birth;
  - place of birth;
  - mother‘s maiden name;
  - biometric records (fingerprint, face, etc.);
  - medical records;
  - educational records;
  - financial information; and
  - employment information.
- Organizations that **collect** PII are responsible to **protect** it

---

### Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness (NORA)

- We are constantly being **monitored**. This information can then be aggregated to **create profiles** of each and every one of us. 

- Organizations collect data that needs to be protected, such as:
  - **Location**
  - Web-surfing **habits** 
  - **Criminal** record 
  - **Credit scores**

- This process of **collecting** large quantities of a variety of information and then **combining** it to create **profiles of individuals** is known as `non-obvious relationship awareness, or NORA`. 
  - First commercialized by big casinos looking to find cheaters, NORA is used by both government agencies and private organizations, and it is big business.
