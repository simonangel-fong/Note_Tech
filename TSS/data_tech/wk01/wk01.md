## What is Data?

- The process of working with data typically involves **collecting**, **storing**, **cleaning**, **processing**, and **analyzing** it to extract useful information.
- e.g.,
  - can help us improve efficiency by identifying areas where processes can be optimized or streamlined.
  - used to measure performance and track progress over time.
  - identify opportunities for growth or new business ventures.
  - identify new markets or product opportunities.
  - used to solve complex problems by identifying patterns or correlations that may not be immediately apparent.

- Understand and describe the various structures of data

## Data Structures

- `Data structures`

  - the **organized methods** used to **store** and **retrieve** data within a database,
  - used to **organize and store** data in a way that allows efficient access and modification.

---

- `Flat Files`

  - a simple database in which similar strings of data are **stored as records in a table**.
    - e.g., excel
  - has a **simple structure**
    - **first row** contains the field name for each column
    - each row after that represents a single record
      - Each row has the same type of information.
    - columns
      - describe the type of data
      - sets a limit on the number of characters
        - no predetermined limits for the number of rows
      - separated by a comma or tab
  - limitations: **not** suitable for **large-scale**, **complex** data management
    - lack of **scalability** and data **integrity**
    - not enforce data **constraints** and relationships

---

- `Relational Databases`

  - a collection of information that **organizes data in predefined relationships**.
    - organizes data into **one or more tables**, each of which has a set of **columns** and **rows**.
    - The `columns` represent the **attributes** or fields of the data, while the `rows` represent individual **records**.
  - first proposed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970
  - data is stored in a **normalized form**
    - redundant data is eliminated
    - each piece of data is stored in only one place
    - ensure data consistency and integrity.
  - use `Structured Query Language (SQL)` to **manipulate** data.
  - e.g., MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

---

- `NoSQL (Not only SQL)`
  - a type of database management system (DBMS) that is designed to **handle unstructured or semi-structured data**, such as documents, graphs, and key-value pairs, which are not well-suited to traditional relational databases.
  - allows data to be stored and accessed in a **variety of formats** without needing to define a **strict schema in advance**.
  - ability to handle large volumes of data, high scalability, and fast performance.

---

- `data warehouse`
  - a large, **centralized repository of data** that is specifically designed for **querying** and **analysis**, rather than transaction processing.
  - a type of database that is **optimized for business intelligence (BI)** and **reporting** applications, where users can extract insights and information from vast amounts of data stored within the warehouse.
  - structured according to a `dimensional model`, which organizes data into `fact tables` and `dimension tables`.
    - `Fact tables` contain **measurements** or **metrics**, such as sales or revenue,
    - `dimension tables` contain **attributes** or **characteristics**, such as customer demographics or product categories.

- Discuss to consider on which data source to use
- Model generating a data source

## Data Sources Types

- `Primary data sources`

  - data that is **collected directly** from the **source**.
  - data is collected specifically for the research project or study at hand.
  - e.g., surveys, focus groups, interviews, and experiments.
  - Advantages:
    - tailored specifically to the research question at hand, which can increase the **accuracy** and **relevance** of the data.
  - Disadvantages:
    - time-consuming and expensive.

- `Secondary data sources`

  - data that has **already been collected** by someone else for a different purpose.
  - e.g., academic journals, reports, and databases.
  - Advantages:
    - **readily available** and can be **less expensive** than collecting primary data.
  - Disadvantages:
    - the data may **not be tailored to your needs**, and there may be concerns about the **accuracy** or **relevance** of the data.

- `Internal Data Sources`

  - generated **within an organization**,
    - e.g., sales data, customer data, and website analytics.
  - often used for business intelligence and decision-making within the organization.
  - Advantage:
    - **specific to the organization** and can provide **valuable insights** into its operations.
  - Disadvantage:
    - limited in scope and may **not provide a complete picture** of external market conditions.

- `External data sources`

  - data that comes from **outside the organization**,
    - e.g., government data, social media data, and market research reports.
  - provide information on market trends, consumer behavior, and industry analysis.
  - Advantage:
    - can provide a **broader perspective on the market and industry**.
  - Disadvantage:
    - **expensive** to obtain and may **not** be specifically **tailored** to the organization's needs.

- factors for choosing the data source

  - Quality: Is the data accurate, is the data complete?
  - Availability: Is the data readily available, what costs are involved?
  - Timeliness: Is the data up to date?

- Dot Voting
  - a tool used in Agile where participants are each given a set number of dot stickers
  - Everyone has 3 “dots”
  - primary data source
