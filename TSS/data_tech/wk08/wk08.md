Understand what DML is
Understand the various DML statements and their uses
Practice DML statements

## SQL DML

- `SQL DML (Data Manipulation Language)`

  - a subset of SQL used to **retrieve**, **insert**, **update**, and **delete** data within a database.

- used to **manipulate the data** stored in the tables of a database.
- focuses on the **record-level operations** rather than the structure of the database.

---

- Common DML Statements

- SELECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- MERGE (not a focus in this class)

---

### SELECT Statement

- The SELECT statement is used to **retrieve data** from one or more tables in a database.

- It allows you to **specify the columns** to be returned and apply conditions to filter the data.

- Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition

---Example:
SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > 50000
```

---

### INSERT Statement

- The INSERT statement is used to **insert new rows** of data into a table.
- It allows you to **specify the columns and values** for the new row.

- Syntax:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...)

-- Example:
INSERT INTO Customers (name, email)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
```

---

### UPDATE Statement

- The UPDATE statement is used to **modify existing data** in a table.

- It allows you to **specify the columns and values** to be updated and apply conditions to **filter** the rows.

- Syntax:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition

-- Example:
UPDATE Orders
SET status = 'Shipped'
WHERE order_id = 1001
```

---

### DELETE Statement

- The DELETE statement is used to **remove rows of data** from a table.

- It allows you to specify conditions to **filter** the rows to be deleted.

- Syntax:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition

-- Example:
DELETE FROM Products
WHERE quantity < 10
```

Understand what a SQL Sequence is
Understand the purpose of a SQL Sequence
Practice SQL Sequences

## SQL Sequences

- `SQL sequences`

  - database **objects**
  - used to **generate unique numeric values**.
  - often used to **provide surrogate keys** for tables.

- `Sequences` are **independent** of any table and can be **shared among multiple tables**.

---

### CREATE Statement

- The `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement is used to **create a sequence** in SQL.
- You can specify

  - the **starting** value,
  - increment,
  - and other properties of the sequence.

- Syntax:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
START WITH start_value
INCREMENT BY increment_value
MINVALUE min_value
MAXVALUE max_value;

-- Example:
CREATE SEQUENCE CustomerID_seq
AS INT
START WITH 1029
INCREMENT BY 1;
```

---

### Accessing Sequence Values

- The `NEXTVAL` function is used to retrieve the next value from a sequence.

  - It **increments** the sequence and **returns the new value**.

- The `CURRVAL` function is used to retrieve the current value of a sequence **without incrementing** it.

- Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (Id, FirstName, LastName, StreetAddress, City, Province, PostalCode, AreaCode, PhoneNumber)
VALUES (NEXT VALUE FOR CustomerID_seq, 'Shelley', 'Smith' , '111 Wellington Road', 'London', 'ON', 'N6C 5Y2', '519', '709-6881');
```

### Viewing in SSMS

- “Sequences” in **Object Explorer** and looking for our sequence name.
  - programmability > Sequences
- Statement

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sys.sequences
WHERE name = 'CustomerID_seq';
-- CustomerID_seq	338100245	NULL	1	0	SO	SEQUENCE_OBJECT	2025-03-04 20:17:18.443	2025-03-04 20:17:18.443	0	0	0	1000	1	-2147483648	2147483647	0	1	NULL	56	56	10	0	1002	0	1002
```

---

### Modifying a Sequence

- The `ALTER SEQUENCE` statement is used to **modify the properties** of a sequence.

You can change the **increment**, **minimum** value, **maximum** value, and other attributes of the sequence.

- Example: 

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE student_id_seq 
INCREMENT BY 2
```

---

### Dropping a Sequence

- The `DROP SEQUENCE` statement is used to **remove a sequence** from the database.
  - Be cautious when dropping a sequence as it **cannot be undone**.

```sql
-- Example: 
DROP SEQUENCE CustomerID_seq
```
