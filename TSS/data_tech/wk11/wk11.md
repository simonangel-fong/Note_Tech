## Data Validation

- `Data validation`

  - a critical **process in ensuring** the **accuracy**, **integrity**, and **quality** of data stored in a database.

- It helps prevent data **inconsistencies**, **errors**, and **invalid entries** that can impact the functionality and reliability of applications and reports.

---

### Where is it done

- Let’s look around the web, where do we see data validation happening and what is driving it?
- Would there be **more then 1 level** of validation?
- What if you are moving data from one database to another?
- What if it’s data being inputted by a user in a form?

---

### Nullability Constraint

- `Nullability constraint`

  - ensures that a **column or field cannot have a null** (empty) value.

- It enforces the requirement for **mandatory data entry**.

- As we know, this is done at the **column level**.

---

### Data Type Constraint

- `Data type constraint`

  - ensures that the data entered in a column **matches the specified data type**.

- It **prevents incompatible data** from being stored, such as attempting to store a string in a numeric field.

---

### Length Constraint

- `Length constraint` defines the **maximum length** of a string, or the **number of digits** allowed in a numeric field.
- It helps ensure that data **fits** within the defined **limits**.

---

### Range Constraint

- `Range constraint` sets the **acceptable range** of values for a **numeric column**.
- It **prevents** data entry of values **outside the defined range**.

---

### Unique Constraint

- `Unique constraint` ensures that each value in a column is **unique** within the table.
- It **prevents duplicate entries**, enforcing data integrity.

---

### Check Constraint

- `Check constraint` applies a **condition** or expression to a column, allowing only values that meet the specified criteria.

- It provides **custom validation rules** for data entry.

---

### Foreign Key Constraint

- `Foreign key constraint` **establishes a relationship** between **two tables** based on a key.

- It ensures **referential integrity** by preventing the insertion of invalid foreign key values.

---

### Stored Procs/Functions

- `Stored procedures` (more on this in Level 2) and `functions` can perform complex data validation logic using SQL statements and programming constructs.

- They can **be called to validate data** before it is processed or stored.

---

### Data Validation

- `Data validation` is crucial for ensuring data **accuracy**, **integrity**, and **quality**.

  - Data validation should be found at **many steps** along the **collection** and **storage** of data.

- At the **database level** different types of **constraints**, such as nullability, data type, length, range, unique, foreign key, and check constraints, can be used for data validation.

- Stored **procedures**, and **functions** are effective methods for implementing data validation logic.
