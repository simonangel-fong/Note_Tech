- Understand and describe data types
- Model the use of data types

## Data Types

- `Data types`

  - defines **what value** a database column **can hold**
  - help define the **structure** and **characteristics** of the data that is being stored
  - also **identifies** how the database will **interact with** the stored data

- Three main data types we will be using in our Relational databases are:
  - String
  - Numeric
  - Date and time

---

- `Boolean`
  - used to **store values that are either true or false.**
- `Integer`
  - this data type is used to **store whole numbers** (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).
  - Integers have a **maximum** and **minimum** value that depends on the number of bits used to store them.
- `Float/Double`
  - these data types are used to **store decimal numbers**.
    - `Floats` are typically used for **smaller** decimal values
    - `doubles` are used for **larger** ones.
- `String/Character`
  - data types used to **store text or character data**.
    - `Strings` can be of **variable length**
    - `characters` are typically **fixed length**.
- `Date/Time`
  - data types used to **store dates and times**.
  - They can be **formatted in various ways**, depending on the requirements of the application.
- `BLOB`
  - data type used to **store binary data**
  - e.g., images, videos, or other files.

---

- Why
  - The choice of data type **depends on the nature of the data** being stored and the operations that will be performed on it.
  - Choosing the appropriate data type can help ensure **data integrity** and **optimize performance**.

---

- e.g.:
  - Employee’s Birth Date - Date/Time
  - Customer’s First Name - String
  - Quantity of a Product - Integer
  - Cost of a Product - Float/Double
  - Order Number - Integer
  - Customer’s Phone Number - String

## Normalization

- Understand the **purpose** of Normalization
- Model the **use** of Normalization

---

- `Normalization`
  - the **process of organizing data** into tables and relationships **to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity**
  - It involves **dividing** a database **into smaller tables** and **defining relationships between them** to ensure that the data is **stored logically and efficiently**.

---

### Primary Keys and FK

- `Primary Key (PK)`

  - the column or columns that contain values that **uniquely identify each row** in a table
  - A PK value must be **unique** and must **not be NULL**
    - e.g.: Student Number, SIN, Employee ID

- `Foreign Keys (FK)`
  - In order to link tables together we use Primary (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK).
  - Foreign Keys are columns that **match** the `Primary Keys` **in another table**.

---

### Normal Forms

- `Normal Forms`
  - a series of steps and rules of Normalization
- At a practical level, most databases **never get past 3rd normal form**.

- Levels of normalization are as follows:

  - 1st normal
  - 2nd normal
  - 3rd normal
  - Boyce-Codd Normal
  - 4th normal
  - 5th normal
  - Domain-Key Normal
  - 6th normal

- **Highest** level implies **compliance** with **lower** levels.
  - In other words, if a table is in 3rd normal form, then it is expected we have **complied** with all the rules for 1st and 2nd normal as well.

---

| Normal Form | Key Focus                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1NF         | Ensure atomic values and no repeating groups. |
| 2NF         | Eliminate partial dependencies.               |
| 3NF         | Eliminate transitive dependencies.            |

---

### First Normal Form (1NF)

- 1st Normal form rules are as follows:

  - Each table should have a `primary key` 必须有 pk
  - **Atomicity (Atomic Values)**:每列只有一个值
    - Each column must contain only atomic (indivisible) values. No lists, arrays, or sets are allowed in a single column.
  - **Uniqueness of Rows**: 没有重复记录
    - Each row must be unique, meaning the table should have a primary key or unique identifier.

---

### 2nd Normal Form

- `Partial Dependency`:
  - Occurs when a **non-prime attribute** depends on **only part** of a composite primary key, rather than the whole key.
- `composite key`

  - PK made up of more than 1 attribute or column

- 2nd Normal Form rules:
  - **Meet 1NF**:
    - The table must first satisfy all the rules of First Normal Form (1NF).
  - **Eliminate Partial Dependencies**:
    - Every non-prime attribute (a column that is not part of the primary key) must **depend on the entire** `primary key`, not just part of it.
    - e.g.， **Student_ID + Course_ID**： Grade

---

### 3rd Normal Form

- `Transitive Dependency`:

  - A situation where a non-prime attribute **depends on another non-prime attribute**, which in turn depends on the primary key.

- 3rd Normal Form rules:

  - **Meet 2NF**:
    - The table must already be in Second Normal Form.
  - **Eliminate `Transitive Dependencies`**:
    - No non-prime attribute (non-key column) should depend on another non-prime attribute
    - Every non-prime attribute must be directly dependent on the primary key.

---

### Exceptions

- Exceptions to consider:
  - Typically, we do not normalize the following:
    - Names and address information
    - The information is typically accessed together
      - i.e. Customer name and address information will be in 1 table
    - Numbers
    - Dates

---

- The General Rule

  - First Normal form

    - If you see a **repeating attribute** (ie Hobby1, Hobby2, etc) or multiple values in 1 attribute…
    - You must break the table into two (one to many) or three (many to many) and add a foreign key relationship.

  - Third Normal form
    - If you see **information repeating in a column** when looking at data in the table...
    - Consider breaking the table into two (one to many) or three (many to many) and add a foreign key relationship.

- Each row or “instance” of data should have a Primary key.
- To relate tables, create a Foreign Key.
- Always…Always…Always… the Foreign key goes on the many side of the relationship.
