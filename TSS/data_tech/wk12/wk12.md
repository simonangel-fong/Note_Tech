## ACID Transactions

- `ACID` stands for

  - Atomicity,
  - Consistency,
  - Isolation, and
  - Durability.

- ACID transactions are a **set of properties** that **guarantee reliable and consistent database operations**.

---

### Atomicity Property

- `Atomicity` ensures that a **transaction** is treated as a **single**, **indivisible unit of work**.
- Either all the operations within the transaction are successfully **completed**, or **none** of them are.

---

### Consistency Property

- `Consistency` ensures that a transaction brings the database **from one valid state** to **another**.

- It enforces **data integrity rules** and **constraints**, **preventing** the database from being left in an **inconsistent state**.

---

### Isolation Property

- `Isolation` ensures that **each transaction** is executed **independently** and in **isolation** from **other** transactions.

- It **prevents interference** between **concurrent transactions**, maintaining data **integrity** and preventing **conflicts**.

---

### Durability Property

- `Durability` guarantees that once a transaction is **committed**, its **changes are permanent** and will **survive** any subsequent **failures**.

- The changes made by a committed transaction are **stored safely** and can be **recovered** even in the event of a system crash or power **failure**.

---

## ACID Transactions in Practice

- `Transaction control statements`

  - used to manage `ACID` transactions in SQL.
  - e.g., `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`

- `transaction Isolation levels`

  - determine the **level of data visibility and concurrency control** within transactions.
  - Databases provide different `transaction isolation levels`
  - e.g.,
    - **Read Uncommitted**,
    - **Read Committed**,
    - **Repeatable Read**,
    - and **Serializable**.

- `Transaction logging`
  - records **all the changes** made within a transaction in a `log file`.
  - In case of a **failure**, the database can use the `log file` to **recover and restore** the database to a consistent state.

---

## ACID Transactions

- ACID transactions provide **essential properties** for ensuring **reliable and consistent database operations**.

- Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability are the core principles of ACID transactions.

- `Transaction control statements`, `isolation levels`, and `transaction logging` contribute to implementing ACID transactions.

---

## DFD Diagrams

- `DFD Diagrams`

  - graphical representations of the **flow of data** within a system.
  - They **illustrate** how data **moves** through **processes**, data **stores**, and **external entities** in a system.

- Symbols
  - `External Entity`: Represents an **external source or destination** of data.
  - `Process`: Represents a **function** or **action** performed on data.
  - `Data Store`: Represents a **storage location** for data.
  - `Data Flow`: Represents the **movement of data** between processes, data stores, and external entities.

---

### DFD Levels

- DFDs can be created at different levels of abstraction:
  - **Level 0 DFD**: Provides an overview of the **entire system**, showing major **processes** and **external entities**.
  - **Level 1 DFD**: Expands on the processes of the Level 0 DFD, showing **sub-processes** and **more detail**.
  - **Level 2 (and higher) DFDs**: Continue to **break down** processes into more detailed sub-processes.

---

### Steps to Create a DFD

- Identify the system **boundaries**: Define what is **included** and **excluded** from the system being modeled.
- Identify `external entities`: Determine the **external sources and destinations of data**.
- Identify `processes`: Identify the **functions or actions** that **manipulate** data.
- Identify `data flows`: Determine how data **moves** between processes, data stores, and external entities.
- Identify `data stores`: Identify **where data is stored** within the system.

---

### Advantages

- Provides a **clear visualization** of the data flow within a system.
- Identifies **inputs**, **outputs**, and **processes** involved in **data transformation**.
- Helps identify data **redundancy** and **inefficiencies**.
- Facilitates **communication** between stakeholders, developers, and analysts.

---

### Limitations

- **Limited** in representing **complex business rules** and calculations.
- Does not show **timing** or **sequencing of activities**.
- Can become **overly complex** for large and intricate systems.
