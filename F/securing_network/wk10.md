## Electronic Mail Security

## Email Protocols

Two types of protocols are used for transferring email:

- Used to move messages through the Internet **from source to destination**
  - `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)`
- Used to transfer messages **between mail servers**

  - `IMAP` and `POP` are the most commonly used

---

### SMTP

- `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol`
  - Is a text-based client-server protocol
  - Encapsulates an email message in an envelope and is used to **relay the encapsulated messages** from source to destination through multiple `MTAs`
  - Was originally specified in 1982 as RFC 821
  - The term `Extended SMTP (ESMTP)` is often used to refer to later versions of SMTP

---

### STARTTLS

- A significant **security**-related extension for `SMTP`
- Defined in RFC 3207 (SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security, February 2002)
- Enables the addition of **confidentiality** and **authentication** in the exchange between SMTP agents
- This gives SMTP agents the ability to protect some or all of their communication from eavesdroppers and attackers
- Advantage of using `STARTTLS` is that the server can offer `SMTP` service **on a single port**, rather than requiring separate port numbers for secure and cleartext operations

---

### Mail Access Protocols

- `POP3(Post Office Protocol)`

  - Allows an email client to **download** an email from an email server (`MTA`)
  - POP3 user agents connect via `TCP` to the server
  - After authorization, the UA can issue POP3 commands to retrieve and delete mail

- `IMAP(Internet Mail Access Protocol)`

  - Enables an email client to **access mail** on an email server
  - Also uses `TCP`, with server TCP port `143`
  - Is more complex than POP3
  - Provides stronger authentication and provides other functions not supported by POP3

---

## Email formats

### RFC 5322

- Messages are viewed as having an **envelope** and **contents**
  - The `envelope` contains whatever information is needed to accomplish transmission and delivery
  - The `contents` compose the object to be delivered to the recipient
- RFC 5322
  - Defines a **format** for text messages that are sent using electronic mail
- RFC 5322 standard applies **only to the contents**
  - The content standard includes a set of header fields that may be used by the mail system to create the envelope

---

### Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)

- An extension to the RFC 5322 framework that is intended to address some of the problems and limitations of the use of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
- Is intended to resolve these problems in a manner that is compatible with existing RFC 5322 implementations
- The specification is provided in RFCs 2045 through 2049

- Five new message header fields are defined, which may be included in an RFC 5322 header; these fields provide information about the body of the message
- A number of content formats are defined, thus standardizing representations that support multimedia electronic mail
- Transfer encodings are defined that enable the conversion of any content format into a form that is protected from alteration by the mail system

---

### Limitations of the SMTP/5322 Scheme

- SMTP cannot transmit executable files or other binary objects
- SMTP cannot transmit text data that includes national language characters
- SMTP servers **may** reject mail message over a certain size
- SMTP gateways that translate between ASCII and the character code EBCDIC do not use a consistent set of mappings, resulting in translation problems
- SMTP gateways to X.400 electronic mail networks cannot handle nontextual data included in X.400 messages
- Some SMTP implementations do not adhere completely to the SMTP standards defined in RFC 821

---

### MIME Specifications

- **MIME-Version**
  - Must have the parameter value 1.0
  - This field indicates that the message conforms to RFCs 2045 and 2046
- **Content-Type**
  - Describes the data contained in the body with sufficient detail that the receiving user agent can pick an appropriate agent or mechanism to represent the data to the user or otherwise deal with the data in an appropriate manner
- **Content-Transfer-Encoding**
  - Indicates the type of transformation that has been used to represent the body of the message in a way that is acceptable for mail transport
- **Content-ID**
  - Used to identify MIME entities uniquely in multiple contexts
- **Content-Description**
  - A text description of the object with the body; this is useful when the object is not readable

---

### Formats

- `Native Form`

  - The body to be transmitted is created **in the system’s native format**
  - The native character set is used and, where appropriate, local end-of-line conventions are used as well
  - The body may be any format that corresponds to the local model for the representation of some form of information
  - Examples include a UNIX-style text file, or a Sun raster image, or a VMS indexed file, and audio data in a system-dependent format stored only in memory

- `Canonical Form`
  - The entire body, including out-of-band information such as record lengths and possibly file attribute information, is **converted to a universal canonical form**
  - The specific media type of the body as well as its associated attributes dictates the nature of the canonical form that is used
  - Conversion to the proper canonical form may involve character set conversion, transformation of audio data, compression, or various other operations specific to the various media types

---

### Email Security Threats

- **Authenticity**-related threats
  - Could result in **unauthorized** access to an enterprise’s email system
- **Integrity**-related threats
  - Could result in unauthorized **modification** of email content
- **Confidentiality**-related threats
  - Could result in unauthorized **disclosure** of sensitive information
- **Availability**-related threats
  - Could **prevent** end users from being able to send or receive mail

---

## Counter Threat Protocols

- **SP800-177** recommends use of a variety of standardized protocols as a means for countering threats:
- `STARTTLS`
  - An SMPT security extension that provides authentication, integrity, non-repudiation and confidentiality for the entire SMTP message by running SMTP over TLS
- `S/MIME`
  - Provides authentication, integrity, non-repudiation and confidentiality of the message body carried in SMTP messages
- `DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)`
  - Provides authentication and integrity protection of DNS data, and is an underlying tool used by various email security protocols
- `DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)`

  - Is designed to overcome problems in the certificate authority (CA) system by providing an alternative channel for authenticating public keys based on DNSSEC, with the result that the same trust relationships used to certify IP addresses are used to certify servers operating on those addresses

- `Sender Policy Framework (SPF)`
  - Uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to allow domain owners to create records that associate the domain name with a specific IP address range of authorized message senders.
- `DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)`
  - Enables an MTA to sign selected headers and the body of a message. This validates the source domain of the mail and provides message body integrity
- `Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)`
  - Lets senders know the proportionate effectiveness of their SPF and DKIM policies, and signals to receivers what action should be taken in various individual and bulk attack scenarios

---

### Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (S/MIME)

- `Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (S/MIME)`

  - A security **enhancement to the MIME Internet** e-mail format standard based on technology from RSA Data Security

---

- **Authentication**
- Provided by means of a **digital signature**
  - The sender creates a message
  - `SHA-256` is used to generate a 256-bit message digest of the message
  - The message digest is encrypted with `RSA` using the sender’s `private key`, and the result is appended to the message. Also appended is identifying information for the signer, which will enable the receiver to retrieve the signer’s public key
  - The receiver uses `RSA` with the sender’s `public key` to decrypt and recover the message digest
  - The receiver generates a new message digest for the message and compares it with the decrypted hash code. If the two match, the message is accepted as authentic
- **Detached signatures** are supported

  - A detached signature may be stored and transmitted **separately** from the message it signs

---

- **Confidentiality**
- S/MIME provides confidentiality by **encrypting messages**
  - Most commonly `AES` with a **128-bit key** is used, with the `cipher block chaining (CBC)` mode
- The key itself is also encrypted, typically with RSA
- Each symmetric key, referred to as a content-encryption key, is used only once
  - A new key is generated as a random number for each message
  - Because it is to be used only once, the content-encryption key is bound to the message and transmitted with it
  - To protect the key, it is encrypted with the receiver’s public key
  - To reduce encryption time, the combination of symmetric and public-key encryption is used
  - Only the recipient is able to recover the session key that is bound to the message

---

- **E-mail Compatibility**

- Many electronic mail systems only permit the use of blocks consisting of **ASCII text**
- To accommodate this restriction, S/MIME provides the service of converting the **raw 8-bit binary** stream to a stream of printable ASCII characters
- The scheme used for this purpose is **Base-64** conversion
  - Each group of three octets of binary data is mapped into four ASCII characters
  - The Base64 algorithm blindly converts the input stream to Base64 format regardless of content, even if the input happens to be ASCII text
- RFC 5751 recommends that even if outer 7-bit encoding is not used, the original MIME content should be 7-bit encoded

---

- **Compression**
- S/MIME offers the ability to compress a message
- This has the benefit of saving space both for email transmission and for file storage
- Compression can be applied in any order with respect to the signing and message encryption operations
- RFC 5751 provides these guidelines:
  - Compression of binary encoded encrypted data is discouraged, since it will not yield significant compression; Base64 encrypted data could very well benefit, however
  - If a lossy compression algorithm is used with signing, you will need to compress first, then sign

---

- **S/MIME Message Content Types**
- **Data**

  - Refers to the inner **MIME-encoded message content**, which may then be encapsulated in a **SignedData**, **EnvelopedData**, or **CompressedData** content type

- `SignedData`
  - Used to apply a **digital signature** to a message
- `EnvelopedData`
  - This consists of encrypted content of any type and encrypted content encryption keys for one or more recipients
- `CompressedData`
  - Used to apply data compression to a message
- `Clear signing`
  - A digital signature is calculated for a MIME-encoded message and the two parts, the message and signature, form a multipart MIME message
  - Can be read and their signatures verified by email entities that do not implement S/MIME

---

#### Securing a MIME Entity

- S/MIME secures a MIME entity with a **signature**, **encryption**, or both
- The MIME entity is prepared according to the normal rules for MIME message preparation
  - The MIME entity plus some security-related data, such as algorithm identifiers and certificates, are processed by S/MIME to produce what is known as a PKCS object
  - A PKCS object is then treated as message content and wrapped in MIME
- In all cases the message to be sent is converted to canonical form

---

#### S/MIME Certificate Processing

- S/MIME uses **public-key certificates** that conform to version 3 of `X.509`
- S/MIME managers and/or users must configure each client with a list of trusted keys and with certificate revocation lists
- The responsibility is local for maintaining the certificates needed to verify incoming signatures and to encrypt outgoing messages
- The certificates are signed by certification authorities

---

#### Enhanced Security Services

- RFC 2634 defines four enhanced security services for S/MIME:
- **Signed receipt**
  - Returning a signed receipt provides proof of delivery to the originator of a message and allows the originator to demonstrate to a third party that the recipient received the message
- **Security labels**
  - A set of security information regarding the sensitivity of the content that is protected by S/MIME encapsulation
- **Secure mailing lists**
  - An S/MIME Mail List Agent (MLA) can take a single incoming message, perform the recipient-specific encryption for each recipient, and forward the message
- **Signing certificates**
  - This service is used to securely bind a sender’s certificate to their signature through a signing certificate attribute

---

#### Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

- **Alternative** email security protocol which has essentially the same functionality as `S/MIME`
- It was made available free of charge and became popular for personal use
- The initial protocol was proprietary and used some encryption algorithms with intellectual property restrictions
- `OpenPGP` was developed as a new standard protocol based on PGP version 5.x
- OpenPGP is defined in RFC 4880 and RFC 3156
- There are two significant differences between S/MIME and OpenPGP:
  - Key Certification
  - Key Distribution
- NIST 800-177 recommends the use of S/MIME rather than PGP because of the greater confidence in the CA system of verifying public keys

---

### DNSSEC

#### Domain Name System (DNS)

- A directory lookup service that provides a mapping between the name of a host on the Internet and its numeric IP address
- Is essential to the functioning of the Internet
- Is used by `MUAs` and `MTAs` to find the address of the next hop server for mail delivery
- Is comprised of four elements:
  - Domain name space
  - DNS database
  - Name servers
  - Resolvers

---

- DNS Database

- DNS is based on a hierarchical database containing `resource records (RRs)` that include the **name**, IP **address**, and other information about hosts
- The key features of the database are:
  - Variable-depth hierarchy for names
  - Distributed database
  - Distribution controlled by the database
  - Using this database, DNS servers provide a name-to-address directory service for network applications that need to locate specific servers

---

#### DNSSEC

- `DNS Security Extensions`
- Provides **end-to-end protection** through the use of **digital signatures** that are created by responding zone administrators and verified by a recipient’s resolver software
- Avoids the need to trust intermediate name servers and resolvers that cache or route the DNS records originating from the responding zone administrator before they reach the source of the query
- Consists of a set of new resource record types and modifications to the existing DNS protocol

---

#### DNSSEC Operation

- In essence, DNSSEC is designed to **protect DNS clients** from accepting forged or altered DNS resource records
- It does this by using digital signatures to provide:
  - Data **origin authentication**
    - Ensures that data has originated from the **correct source**
  - Data **integrity verification**
    - Ensures that the content of a RR has not been modified
- Trust in the `public key` of the source is established by starting from a trusted zone and establishing the chain of trust down to the current source of response through successive verifications of signature of the public key of a child by its parent
  - The `public key` of the trusted zone is called the `trust anchor`

---

### DANE

- `DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities`
  - Is a protocol to allow `X.509` certificates, commonly used for `Transport Layer Security (TLS)` to be bound to DNS names using DNSSEC
- It is proposed in RFC 6698 as a way to **authenticate TLS** client and server entities **without a certificate authority (CA)**
- The purpose of DANE is to **replace reliance on the security of the CA system** with reliance on the security provided by DNSSEC

---

### Sender Policy Framework (SPF)

- SPF is the standardized way for a **sending domain to identify and assert the mail sender**s for a given domain
- RFC 7208 defines the SPF
  - It provides a protocol by which ADMDs can authorize hosts to use their domain names in the “MAIL FROM” or “HELLO” identities
- SPF works by **checking a sender’s IP address** against the **policy** encoded in any SPF record found at the sending domain
  - This means that SPF **checks** can be applied **before** the message content is **received from the sender**

---

### DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

- A specification for **cryptographically signing e-mail messages**, permitting a signing domain to claim responsibility for a message in the mail stream
- Message recipients can **verify the signature** by querying the **signer’s domain** directly to retrieve the appropriate public key and can thereby confirm that the message was attested to by a party in possession of the private key for the signing domain
- Proposed Internet Standard RFC 6376
- Has been **widely adopted** by a range of e-mail providers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

---

## E-mail Threats

- Characterized on three levels of threat:

- At the **low end** are attackers who simply want to send e-mail that a recipient **does not want to receive**
- The next level are **professional senders** of **bulk spam mail** and often operate as commercial enterprises and send messages on behalf of third parties
- The most **sophisticated** and financially motivated senders of messages are those who stand to receive substantial **financial benefit**, such as from an e-mail based fraud scheme

---

### DMARC

- `Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance`
  - Allows email senders to specify **policy on how their mail should be handled**, the types of reports that receivers can send back, and the frequency those reports should be sent
- It is defined in RFC 7489 (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance, March 2015)

---
