## Network Security

### Cryptographic algorithms and protocols

- `Symmetric encryption`:

  - Used to **conceal** the contents of blocks or streams of data of **any size**, including messages, files, encryption keys, and passwords.

- `Asymmetric encryption`:

  - Used to **conceal small blocks** of data, such as encryption keys and **hash function values**, which are used in digital signatures.

- `Data integrity algorithms`:

  - Used to protect blocks of data, such as messages, **from alteration**.

- `Authentication protocols`:
  - These are schemes based on the use of cryptographic algorithms designed to **authenticate the identity** of entities.

---

- The field of **network and Internet security** consists of measures to deter, prevent, detect, and correct **security violations** that involve the **transmission** of information.

- `The NIST Computer Security Handbook  [NIST95]` defines the term `computer security` as follows:

  - `Computer Security`: The protection afforded to an **automated** information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of **preserving the integrity, availability, and confidentiality** of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications).

---

### CIA triad

- `Confidentiality`:

  - `Data confidentiality`:
    - Assures that private or confidential information is not made available or disclosed to **unauthorized individuals**.
  - `Privacy`:
    - Assures that individuals **control or influence** what information related to them may be collected and stored and by whom and to whom that information may be disclosed.

- `Integrity`:

  - `Data integrity`:
    - Assures that information and programs are **changed** only in a specified and **authorized** manner.
  - `System integrity`:
    - Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free **from** deliberate or inadvertent **unauthorized manipulation** of the system.

- `Availability`:
  - Assures that systems work promptly and service is **not denied to authorized** users.

---

- Two of the most commonly mentioned

  - `Authenticity`:

    - The property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message originator.

  - `Accountability`:
    - The security goal that generates the requirement for actions of an entity to **be traced uniquely** to that entity. This supports nonrepudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention, and after action recovery and legal action.

---

- three levels of impact on organizations or individuals
  - `Low`: The loss could be expected to have a **limited adverse effect** on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
  - `Moderate`: The loss could be expected to have a **serious adverse effect** on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
  - `High`: The loss could be expected to have a **severe or catastrophic** adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.

---

- `OSI security architecture` focuses on
  - security **attacks**,
    - Any action that **compromises** the security of information owned by an organization.
  - **mechanisms**,
    - A process (or a device incorporating such a process) that is designed to **detect, prevent, or recover** from a security attack.
  - and **services**.
    - A processing or communication **service that enhances the security** of the data processing systems and the information transfers of an organization.

---

### Attack

- A `passive attack`

  - attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does **not affect** system resources.
  - prevent by means of **encryption**
  - on **prevention** rather than detection.
  - Two types of passive attacks are

    - the **release of message contents**: learning the contents of these transmissions.
    - **traffic analysis**: determine the **location and identity** of communicating hosts and could observe the **frequency** and **length** of messages being exchanged.

- An `active attack` attempts to **alter** system resources or affect their operation.

  - difficult to prevent
  - the goal is to detect active attacks and to recover
  - four categories:

    - **masquerade 化装**: one entity **pretends** to be a different entity

    - **replay**,: involves the passive capture, to produce an unauthorized effect
    - **modification of messages**: legitimates message is altered,
    - and **denial of service**: prevents or inhibits the normal use

---

- `authentication`

  - assuring that a communication is authentic.

- Two specific authentication services

  - `Peer entity authentication`: Provides for the corroboration of the **identity** of a **peer entity in an association**.
  - `Data origin authentication`: Provides for the corroboration of the **source** of a data unit.

- `access control`

  - the ability to **limit and control the access** to host systems and applications via communications links.
  - each entity trying to gain access must first be **identified**, or authenticated

- `Confidentiality` is the protection of transmitted data from `passive attacks`

  - the protection of traffic flow **from analysis**

- integrity

  - A `connection-oriented integrity service`, one that deals with a stream of messages, assures that messages are **received as sent** with no duplication, insertion, modification, reordering, or replays.
    - addresses both message **stream modification** and **denial of service**.
  - a `connectionless integrity service`, one that deals with individual messages without regard to any larger context, generally provides protection against **message modification** only.

- `integrity service` relates to `active attacks`, we are concerned with **detection** rather than prevention

- `Nonrepudiation`

  - prevents either sender or receiver from **denying a transmitted message**.

- `availability service`
  - is one that protects a system to **ensure its availability**.
  - This service addresses the security concerns raised by `denial-of-service attacks`.

---

### fundamental security design principles

- **Economy** of mechanism

  - should be as simple and small as possible
  - Relatively simple, small design is easier to **test** and **verify** thoroughly

- **Fail-safe** defaults
  - access decisions should be **based on permission** rather than exclusion
  - Most file access systems and virtually all protected services on client/server use fail-safe defaults
- Complete **mediation**

  - every **access must be checked** against the access control mechanism
  - not rely on cache

- **Open** design

  - the design of a security mechanism should be open rather than secret
  - Although encryption keys must be secret, encryption algorithms should be open to public scrutiny

- **Separation** of privilege
  - **multiple privilege attributes** are required to achieve access to a **restricted resource**
  - e.g.: Multifactor user authentication
- **Least** privilege
  - every process and every user of the system should operate using the **least set of privileges** necessary to perform the task
  - e.g.: **role-based** access control, system security policy
- **Least common** mechanism
  - should **minimize the functions shared** by different users, providing mutual security
  - reduce the number of unintended communication paths and reduces the amount of hardware and software on which all users depend,
- **Psychological** acceptability
  - the security mechanisms should **not interfere** unduly with the work of users, while at the same time meeting the needs of those who authorize access
  - Where possible, security mechanisms should be transparent to the users of the system or, at most, introduce minimal obstruction
- Isolation
  - **Public access** systems should be isolated from **critical resources to prevent disclosure** or tampering
  - Processes and files of **individual users** should be isolated from one another except where it is explicitly desired
  - **Security mechanisms** should be isolated in the sense of preventing access to those mechanisms
- Encapsulation
  - a specific form of isolation based on object-oriented functionality
- Modularity
  - Refers both to the **development** of security functions as separate, protected modules and to the **use** of a modular architecture for mechanism design and implementation
- Layering
  - the use of multiple, overlapping protection approaches addressing the people, technology, and operational aspects of information systems
- Least astonishment
  - a program or user interface should always respond in the way that is **least likely to astonish** the user
  - The **mechanism** for authorization should be **transparent** enough to a user that the user has a good intuitive understanding of how the security goals map to the provided security mechanism

---

- `Attack Surfaces`
  - consists of the reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities in a system
  - e.g.:
    - Open ports
    - Services available on the inside of a firewall
    - Interfaces, SQL
    - social Engineering attack
  - Categories
    - Network attack surface
    - Software attack surface:
    - Human attack surface

---

- `Attack Tree`
  - A branching, hierarchical **data structure** that represents a set of **potential techniques for exploiting** security vulnerabilities
  - The security **incident** that is the **goal of the attack** is represented as the **root node** of the tree, and the **ways** that an attacker could reach that goal are represented as **branches** and **subnodes** of the tree
  - The **final** nodes on the paths outward from the **root**, (leaf nodes), represent different ways to initiate an attack
  - The motivation for the use of attack trees is to effectively exploit the information available on **attack patterns**

---

### Model for Network Security

- Unwanted Access

  - Placement in a computer system of logic that **exploits vulnerabilities** in the system and that can **affect** application programs as well as utility programs such as editors and compilers
  - Programs can present two kinds of threats:
    - **Information access** threats
      - Intercept or modify data **on behalf of users** who should not have access to that data
    - **Service threats**
      - **Exploit service flaws** in computers to inhibit use by legitimate users

- Standards
  - `National Institute of Standards and Technology`: `NIST`
  - `Internet Society:  ISOC `
  - `ITU-T:  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) `
  - `ISO: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) `

- asic concepts
  - **divisibility**,
    - is the ability of a number to be evenly divided by another number.
  - the **Euclidean algorithm**,
  - and **modular arithmetic**.
    - a special type of arithmetic that involves only integers
  - asymmetric (public-key) cryptographic algorithms
    - prime numbers
      - whose only positive divisors are 1 and itself.
      - a natural number with only two positive distinct divisors of 1 and itself.
