- `group`:

  - A set of elements with a binary operation denoted by \* that associates to each ordered pair (a,b) of elements in G an element (a \* b ) in G , such that the following axioms are obeyed

- 略

## Advanced Encryption Standard

- `RSA`

  - a public-key cipher

- `Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)`

  - published by the `National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)`
  - a symmetric block cipher intended to replace `DES`

- In AES, **all** operations are performed on **8-bit bytes**.

  - In particular, the arithmetic operations of addition, multiplication, and division are performed over the `finite field` GF(`2^8`).

- Input:
  - The cipher takes a **plaintext** **block size** of `128 bits`, or `16 bytes`.
  - input block is depicted as a `4 \* 4` square matrix of bytes
  - `State array`, which is modified at each stage of encryption or
    decryption
- Key
  - The key length can be `16`, `24`, or `32` bytes (`128`, `192`, or `256` bits).
  - The algorithm is referred to as `AES-128`, `AES-192`, or `AES-256`, depending on the key length.
  - key is depicted as a **square matrix** of bytes
  - ordering of bytes within a matrix is **by column**.

### Detailed Structure

- that it is **not** a `Feistel` structure.

  - `Feistel`: modify the other half of the data block
  - AES: Processes the **entire data block** as **a single matrix** during each round using substitutions and permutation

- The key that is provided as input is expanded into an array of **forty-four 32-bit words**, `w[i]`
- Four different stages:

  - `Substitute bytes`: perform a **byte-by-byte substitution** of the block
  - `ShiftRows`: A simple **permutation**
  - `MixColumns`: A substitution that makes use of arithmetic over GF(2^8 )
  - `AddRoundKey`: A simple **bitwise XOR** of the current block with a portion of the expanded key

- For **both** encryption and decryption, The cipher **begins** and **ends** with an `AddRoundKey` stage
- Only the `AddRoundKey` stage makes **use of the key**.

- `AddRoundKey` stage is, in effect, a form of `Vernam cipher`
  - other three stages together provide **confusion**, **diffusion**, and **nonlinearity**
- **decryption** algorithm is **not identical** to the **encryption** algorithm

- **final** round of both encryption and decryption consists of **only three** stages.
- Each stage is easily **reversible**

#### S-Box Rationale

- The `S-box` is designed to be **resistant** to known cryptanalytic **attacks**
- The Rijndael developers sought a design that has a **low correlation** between **input** bits and **output** bits and the property that the output is not a linear mathematical function of the input
- The **nonlinearity** is due to the use of the multiplicative inverse

---

#### Shift Row Rationale

- Thus, a row shift **moves an individual byte from one column to another**, which is a linear distance of a multiple of 4 bytes
- **Transformation** ensures that the 4 bytes of one column are spread out to four **different** columns

---

#### Mix Columns Rationale

- The mix column transformation combined with the shift row transformation **ensures** that after a few rounds all **output** bits **depend on all input bits**

---

#### AddRoundKey Transformation

- Rationale:
  - Is as **simple** as possible and **affects every bit of State**
  - The complexity of the round **key expansion** plus the complexity of the other stages of AES **ensure security**

---

#### AES Key Expansion

- `AES key expansion algorithm`

  - Takes as input a `four-word (16 byte)` **key** and produces a **linear array** of `44 words (176) bytes`
  - sufficient to provide a four word round key for the initial AddRoundKey stage

- Rationale:
  - to be **resistant** to known cryptanalytic **attacks**

---

### Equivalent Inverse Cipher

- AES **decryption** cipher is **not identical** to the **encryption** cipher
- The **sequence** of transformations **differs** although the form of the **key** schedules is the **same**
- Has the disadvantage that two separate software or firmware modules are needed for applications that require both encryption and decryption

- Two separate **changes are needed** to bring the **decryption** structure in line with the encryption structure
  - The first two stages of the decryption round need to be interchanged
  - The second two stages of the decryption round need to be interchanged

---

### Implementation Aspects

- AES can be implemented very **efficiently** on an `8-bit` processor
- `AddRoundKey` is a **bytewise XOR** operation
- `ShiftRows` is a simple **byte-shifting** operation
- `SubBytes` operates at the **byte level** and only requires a table of `256 bytes`
- `MixColumns` requires **matrix multiplication** in the field GF(28), which means that all operations are **carried out on bytes**

- Can efficiently implement on a `32-bit` processor
  - Redefine steps to use 32-bit words
  - Can precompute **4** tables of 256-words
  - Then each column in each round can be computed using 4 table lookups + 4 XORs
  - At a cost of 4Kb to store tables
