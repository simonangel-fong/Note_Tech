## IP Security Overview

- RFC 1636
  - “Security in the Internet Architecture”
  - Issued in 1994 by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
  - Identifies key areas for security mechanisms
    - Need to secure the network infrastructure from unauthorized monitoring and control of network traffic
    - Need to secure end-user-to-end-user traffic using authentication and encryption mechanisms
- IAB included authentication and encryption as necessary security features in `the next generation IP (IPv6)`
- The **IPsec specification** now exists as a set of Internet standards

---

### Applications of IPsec

- `IPsec`, or `Internet Protocol Security`

  - a set of protocols that secure data transmission over networks **by encrypting and authenticating IP packets**

- `IPsec` provides the capability to secure communications across a LAN, private and public WANs, and the Internet
  - Examples include:
    - Secure branch office connectivity over the Internet
    - Secure remote access over the Internet
    - Establishing extranet and intranet connectivity with partners
    - Enhancing electronic commerce security
- Principal feature of IPsec is that it can **encrypt** and/or **authenticate** all traffic **at the IP level**
- Thus all distributed applications (remote logon, client/server, e-mail, file transfer, Web access) can be secured

---

### Benefits of IPSec

- Some of the benefits of IPsec:
- When `IPsec` is implemented in a firewall or router, it provides strong security that **can be applied to all traffic crossing the perimeter**
  - Traffic within a company or workgroup does not incur the overhead of security-related processing
- `IPsec` in a firewall is **resistant to bypass** if all traffic from the outside must use IP and the firewall is the only means of entrance from the Internet into the organization
- IPsec is below the transport layer (TCP, UDP) and so is **transparent to applications**
  - There is **no need to change software** on a user or server system when IPsec is implemented in the firewall or router
- IPsec can be **transparent to end users**
  - There is **no need to train users** on security mechanisms, issue keying material on a per-user basis, or revoke keying material when users leave the organization
- IPsec can provide security for individual users if needed
  - This is useful for offsite workers and for setting up a secure virtual subnetwork within an organization for sensitive applications

---

### Routing Applications

- IPsec can assure that:
  - A router **advertisement** comes from an **authorized router**
  - A router seeking to establish or maintain a neighbor relationship with a router in another routing domain is an authorized router
  - A redirect message comes from the router to which the initial IP packet was sent
  - A routing update is not forged

---

### IPsec Documents

- IPsec encompasses three functional areas: **authentication**, **confidentiality**, and **key** management.

- **Architecture**
  - Covers the general concepts, security requirements, definitions, and mechanisms defining IPsec technology
  - The current specification is RFC4301, Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol
- **Authentication Header (AH)**
  - An extension header to provide message authentication
  - The current specification is RFC 4302, IP Authentication Header
- **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)**
  - Consists of an encapsulating header and trailer used to provide encryption or combined encryption/authentication
  - The current specification is RFC 4303, IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
- **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**
  - A collection of documents describing the key management schemes for use with IPsec
  - The main specification is RFC 7296, Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol, but there are a number of related RFCs
- **Cryptographic algorithms**
  - This category encompasses a large set of documents that define and describe cryptographic algorithms for encryption, message authentication, pseudorandom functions (PRFs), and cryptographic key exchange
- **Other**
  - There are a variety of other IPsec-related RFCs, including those dealing with security policy and management information base (MIB) content

---

### IPsec Services

- IPsec provides security services **at the IP layer** by enabling a system to:

  - Select required **security protocols**
  - Determine the **algorithm**(s) to use for the service(s)
  - Put in place any **cryptographic keys** required to provide the requested services

- RFC 4301 lists the following services:
  - **Access** control
  - **Connectionless** integrity
  - Data **origin** authentication
  - Rejection of **replayed packets** (a form of partial sequence integrity)
  - Confidentiality (**encryption**)
  - Limited **traffic flow** confidentiality

---

### Transport and Tunnel Modes

- **Transport Mode**

  - Provides **protection** primarily **for upper-layer protocols**
  - Examples include a `TCP` or `UDP` segment or an `ICMP` packet
  - Typically used for end-to-end communication between two hosts
  - `ESP` in transport mode **encrypts** and optionally **authenticates** the IP **payload** but **not** the IP **header**
  - `AH` in transport mode **authenticates** the IP payload and selected portions of the IP header

- **Tunnel Mode**
  - Provides **protection** to the **entire IP packet**
  - Used when one or both ends of a `security association (SA)` are a **security gateway**
  - A number of hosts on networks behind firewalls may engage in secure communications without implementing IPsec
  - `ESP` in tunnel mode encrypts and optionally **authenticates the entire inner IP packet**, including the inner IP **header**
  - `AH` in tunnel mode **authenticates the entire inner IP packet** and selected portions of the outer IP header

---

### Security Association (SA)

- Uniquely identified by three parameters:

- `Security Parameters Index (SPI)`
  - A 32-bit unsigned integer assigned to this SA and having local significance only
- `IP Destination Address`
  - Address of the destination endpoint of the SA, which may be an end-user system or a network system such as a firewall or router
- `Security protocol identifier`

  - Indicates whether the association is an AH or ESP security association

- A one-way logical connection between a sender and a receiver that affords security services to the traffic carried on it
- In any IP packet, the SA is uniquely identified by the Destination Address in the IPv4 or IPv6 header and the SPI in the enclosed extension header (AH or ESP)

---

### Security Association Database (SAD)

- Defines the **parameters associated with each SA**
- Normally defined by the following parameters in a SAD entry:
  - Security parameter index
  - Sequence number counter
  - Sequence counter overflow
  - Anti-replay window
  - AH information
  - ESP information
  - Lifetime of this security association
  - IPsec protocol mode
  - Path MTU

---

### Security Policy Database (SPD)

- The **means by which** IP traffic is related to specific SAs
  - Contains entries, each of which defines a subset of IP traffic and points to an SA for that traffic
- In more complex environments, there may be multiple entries that potentially relate to a single SA or multiple SAs associated with a single SPD entry
  - Each SPD entry is defined by a set of IP and upper-layer protocol field values called selectors
  - These are used to filter outgoing traffic in order to map it into a particular SA

---

### SPD Entries

- **Remote IP address**
  - This may be a single IP address, an enumerated list or range of addresses, or a wildcard (mask) address
  - The latter two are required to support more than one destination system sharing the same SA
- **Local IP address**
  - This may be a single IP address, an enumerated list or range of addresses, or a wildcard (mask) address
  - The latter two are required to support more than one source system sharing the same SA
- **Next layer protocol**
  - The IP protocol header includes a field that designates the protocol operating over IP
- **Name**
  - A user identifier from the operating system
  - Not a field in the IP or upper-layer headers but is available if IPsec is running on the same operating system as the user
- **Local and remote ports**
  - These may be individual TCP or UDP port values, an enumerated list of ports, or a wildcard port

---

## Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

- `Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)`

  - a security protocol that encrypts and authenticates data packets sent over networks

- Used to **encrypt** the **Payload Data**, **Padding**, **Pad Length**, and **Next Header** fields
  - If the algorithm requires **cryptographic synchronization** data then these data may be carried explicitly at the beginning of the Payload Data field
- An optional `ICV` field is present only if the integrity service is selected and is provided by either a separate integrity algorithm or a combined mode algorithm that uses an ICV
  - `ICV` is computed **after the encryption** is performed
  - This order of processing facilitates reducing the impact of DoS attacks
  - Because the ICV is not protected by encryption, a keyed integrity algorithm must be employed to compute the ICV
- The **Padding field** serves several purposes:
  - If an encryption algorithm requires the plaintext to be a multiple of some number of bytes, the Padding field is used to **expand the plaintext to the required length**
  - Used to assure alignment of Pad Length and Next Header fields
  - Additional padding may be added to provide partial traffic-flow confidentiality by concealing the actual length of the payload

---

## Combining Security Associations

- An `individual SA` can implement either the `AH` or `ESP` protocol but not both
- `Security association bundle`

  - Refers to **a sequence of SAs** through which traffic must be processed to provide a desired set of IPsec services
  - The `SAs` in a bundle may terminate at different endpoints or at the same endpoint

- May be combined into **bundles** in two ways:
- **Transport adjacency**
  - Refers to applying **more than one security protocol** to the same IP packet **without invoking tunneling**
  - This approach allows for **only one level of combination**
- **Iterated tunneling**
  - Refers to the application of **multiple layers** of security protocols effected **through IP tunneling**
  - This approach allows for **multiple levels of nesting**

---

### Approach: ESP with Authentication Option

- In this approach, the first user applies ESP to the data to be protected and then appends the authentication data field
- **Transport mode ESP**
  - Authentication and encryption apply to the IP payload delivered to the host, but the **IP header is not protected**
- **Tunnel mode ESP**
  - Authentication applies to the **entire IP packet** delivered to the outer IP destination address and authentication is performed at that destination
  - The **entire** inner IP packet is **protected** by the privacy mechanism for delivery to the inner IP destination

For both cases **authentication** applies to the **ciphertext** rather than the plaintext

---

### Transport Adjacency

- Another way to apply authentication **after encryption** is to use **two bundled transport SAs**, with the **inner** being an `ESP` SA and the **outer** being an `AH` SA
  - In this case `ESP` is used **without its authentication** option
  - **Encryption** is applied to the **IP payload**
  - `AH` is then applied **in transport mode**
  - Advantage of this approach is that the **authentication covers more fields**
  - Disadvantage is the overhead of **two SAs** versus one SA

---

### Transport-Tunnel Bundle

- The use of authentication **prior to encryption** might be preferable for several reasons:
  - It is **impossible for anyone to intercept** the message and **alter** the authentication data **without detection**
  - It may be desirable to **store the authentication information** with the message at the destination for later reference

---

## Internet Key Exchange(IKE)

- The key management portion of IPsec involves the determination and distribution of secret keys
- A typical requirement is **four keys** for communication between **two applications**
- **Transmit and receive pairs** for both integrity and confidentiality
- The IPsec Architecture document mandates support for **two types** of key management:

  - **Manual**
    - A system administrator **manually configures** each system with its **own keys** and with the keys of other communicating systems
    - This is practical for small, relatively static environments
  - **Automated**
    - Enables the **on-demand creation** of keys for SAs and facilitates the use of keys in a large distributed system with an evolving configuration

---

### ISAKMP/Oakley

- The **default automated** key management protocol of IPsec
- Consists of:
  - `Oakley Key Determination Protocol`
    - A key exchange protocol based on the `Diffie-Hellman` algorithm but providing added security
    - Generic in that it does not dictate specific formats
  - `Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)`
    - Provides a framework for Internet key management and provides the specific protocol support, including formats, for negotiation of security attributes
    - Consists of a set of message types that enable the use of a variety of key exchange algorithms

---

### Features of IKE Key Determination

- Algorithm is characterized by five important features:

  - It employs a mechanism known as **cookies** to thwart `clogging attacks`
  - It enables the **two** parties to **negotiate** a group; this, in essence, specifies the **global parameters** of the `Diffie-Hellman key exchange`
  - It uses **nonces** to ensure against `replay attacks`
  - It enables the **exchange** of **Diffie-Hellman** public key values
  - It **authenticates** the `Diffie-Hellman` exchange to thwart `man-in-the-middle-attacks`
