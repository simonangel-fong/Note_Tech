## User Authentication

### Remote user-authentication principles

- The process of verifying an identity claimed by or for a system entity
- An authentication process consists of two steps:

  - **Identification** step
    - Presenting an **identifier** to the security system
  - **Verification** step
    - Presenting or generating **authentication information** that corroborates the binding between the entity and the identifier

#### Means of User Authentication

- There are **four general means** of authenticating a user’s identity, which can be used alone or in combination

  - Something the **individual knows**
    - Examples include a **password**, a personal identification number (PIN), or answers to a prearranged set of questions
  - Something the **individual possesses**
    - Examples include **cryptographic keys**, electronic keycards, **smart cards**, and physical keys
      - This is referred to as a token
  - Something the **individual is (static biometrics)**
    - Examples include recognition by **fingerprint**, retina, and face
  - Something the **individual does (dynamic biometrics)**
    - Examples include recognition by **voice pattern**, handwriting characteristics, and **typing rhythm**

- For network-based user authentication, the most important methods involve cryptographic keys and something the **individual knows**, such as a password

#### Mutual Authentication

- Protocols which enable communicating parties to satisfy themselves **mutually about each other’s identity** and to **exchange session keys**

- Central to the problem of **authenticated key exchange** are two issues:
  - **Confidentiality**
    - Essential identification and session-key information must be communicated **in encrypted form**
    - This requires the **prior existence** of secret or **public keys** that can be used for this purpose
  - **Timeliness**
    - Important because of the **threat of message replays**
    - Such replays could allow an opponent to:
      - **compromise** a `session key`
      - successfully **impersonate** another party
      - **disrupt** operations by presenting parties with messages that appear genuine but are not

---

##### Replay Attacks

1. The simplest replay attack is one in which the opponent simply c**opies a message and replays** it later
2. An opponent can replay a **timestamped message within the valid time** window
3. An opponent can replay a timestamped message within the valid time window, but in addition, the opponent **suppresses the original** message; thus, the repetition cannot be detected
4. Another attack involves a **backward replay** without modification and is possible if symmetric encryption is used and the **sender cannot easily recognize** the difference between messages sent and messages received on the basis of content

- Approaches to Coping With Replay Attacks

- Attach a **sequence number** to each message used in an authentication exchange
  - A new message is accepted only if its sequence number is **in the proper order**
  - Difficulty with this approach is that it requires each party to keep track of the last sequence number for each claimant it has dealt with
  - Generally **not used** for authentication and key exchange **because of overhead**
- **Timestamps**
  - Requires that **clocks** among the various participants be **synchronized**
  - Party A accepts a message as fresh only if the message contains a timestamp that, in A’s judgment, is close enough to A’s knowledge of current time
- **Challenge/response**
  - Party A, expecting a fresh message from B, first sends B a nonce (challenge) and requires that the subsequent message (response) received from B contain the **correct nonce value**

---

#### One-Way Authentication

- One **application** for which encryption is growing in popularity is **electronic mail (e-mail)**
  - **Header** of the e-mail message **must be in the clear** so that the message can be handled by the **store-and-forward** e-mail protocol, such as SMTP or X.400
  - The e-mail message should be **encrypted** such that the mail-handling system is not in possession of the decryption key
- A second requirement is that of **authentication**
  - The recipient wants some assurance that the message is from the alleged sender

---

### Remote User-Authentication Using `Symmetric Encryption`

- A **two-level hierarchy** of `symmetric keys` can be used to provide confidentiality for communication in a **distributed** environment
  - Strategy involves the use of a trusted `key distribution center (KDC)`
  - Each party **shares a secret key**, known as a `master key`, with the KDC
  - KDC is responsible for generating keys to be used for a short time over a connection between two parties and for distributing those keys using the master keys to protect the distribution

#### Suppress-Replay Attacks

- The Denning protocol requires reliance on clocks that are synchronized throughout the network
- A risk involved is based on the fact that the distributed **clocks can become unsynchronized** as a result of sabotage on or faults in the clocks or the synchronization mechanism
  - The problem occurs when a **sender’s clock** is **ahead** of the intended **recipient’s clock**
  - An opponent can **intercept** a message from the sender and **replay** it later when the timestamp in the message becomes current at the recipient’s site
- Such attacks are referred to as `suppress-replay attacks`

---

### Kerberos

- **Authentication service** developed as part of Project Athena at MIT
- A workstation cannot be trusted to identify its users correctly to network services
  - A user may gain access to a particular workstation and **pretend to be another user** operating from that workstation
  - A user may **alter the network address** of a workstation so that the requests sent from the altered workstation appear to come from the impersonated workstation
  - A user may **eavesdrop on exchanges** and use a **replay** attack to gain entrance to a server or to disrupt operations
- Kerberos provides a **centralized authentication server** whose function is to **authenticate users to servers and servers to users**
  - Relies exclusively on `symmetric encryption`, making **no** use of **public-key encryption**只使用对称加密

---

#### Kerberos Requirements

- **Secure**
  - A network eavesdropper should **not be able to** obtain the necessary information to **impersonate** a user
- **Reliable**
  - Should be highly reliable and should **employ a distributed server architecture** with one system able to **back up** another
- **Transparent**
  - Ideally, the user should **not be aware that authentication** is taking place beyond the requirement to enter a password
- **Scalable**
  - The system should be capable of supporting **large numbers of clients and servers**

---

#### Kerberos Version 4

- Makes use of `DES` to provide the authentication service
- **Authentication server (AS)**
  - **Knows the passwords** of all users and **stores** these in a **centralized database**
  - Shares a `unique secret key` with **each server**
- **Ticket**
  - **Created** once the AS **accepts** the user as authentic; **contains the user’s ID** and network **address** and the **server’s ID**
  - **Encrypted** using the secret key shared by the AS and the server
- **Ticket-granting server (TGS)**

  - **Issues tickets to users** who have been authenticated to AS
  - Each time the user requires access to a new service the client applies to the TGS **using the ticket to authenticate** itself
  - The TGS then grants a ticket for the particular service
  - The client **saves each service-granting ticket** and **uses it to authenticate** its user to a server each time a particular service is requested

- Authentication Dialogue

- The lifetime associated with the `ticket-granting ticket` creates a **problem**:
  - If the lifetime is **very short** (e.g., minutes), the user will be repeatedly **asked for a password**
  - If the lifetime is **long** (e.g., hours), then an opponent has a greater opportunity for **replay**
- A network service (the TGS or an application service) must be able to **prove** that the **person using a ticket is the same person** to whom that ticket was issued
- Servers need to authenticate themselves to users

---

##### Kerberos Realms and Multiple Kerberi

- A full-service Kerberos environment consisting of a Kerberos **server**, a number of **clients**, and a number of **application servers** requires that:
  - The Kerberos **server** must have the **user ID** and **hashed passwords** of all participating users in its database; all users are **registered** with the Kerberos server
  - The Kerberos **server** must **share a secret key with each server**; all servers are **registered** with the Kerberos server
  - The Kerberos server in each interoperating **realm** **shares a secret key** with the server in the **other realm**; the two Kerberos servers are **registered** with each other

---

##### Kerberos Realm

- A set of managed **nodes** that **share the same Kerberos database**
- The database **resides** on the Kerberos **master computer system**, which should be kept in a **physically secure room**
- A read-only **copy** of the Kerberos database might also reside on other Kerberos computer systems
- All **changes** to the database **must** be made on the **master** computer system
- Changing or accessing the contents of a Kerberos database requires the Kerberos master password

---

##### Kerberos Principal

- Kerberos Principal
  - A **service** or **user** that is known to the Kerberos system
- Identified by its **principal name**

- Three parts of a principal name
  - A service or user name
  - An instance name
  - A realm name

---

#### Differences Between Versions 4 and 5

- Version 5 is intended to address the **limitations of version 4** in two areas:
  - **Environmental** shortcomings
    - **Encryption** system dependence
    - **Internet protocol** dependence
    - **Message** byte **ordering**
    - **Ticket lifetime**
    - Authentication **forwarding**
      **Interrealm** authentication
  - Technical deficiencies
    - **Double** encryption
    - **PCBC** encryption
    - **Session** keys
    - **Password attacks**

---

### Remote user-authentication using `asymmetric encryption`

#### Mutual Authentication

- `Public-key encryption` for **session key distribution**
  - Assumes each of the two parties is in **possession** of the current `public key` of the other
  - May not be practical to require this assumption
- `Denning protocol` using **timestamps**
  - Uses an **authentication server (AS)** to provide `public-key certificates`
  - Requires the **synchronization of clocks**
- Woo and Lam makes use of **nonces**
  - Care needed to ensure no protocol flaws

---

#### One-Way Authentication

- Have `public-key` approaches for **e-mail**
  - Encryption of message for **confidentiality, authentication, or both**
  - The `public-key algorithm` must be applied once or twice to what may be a long message
- For confidentiality encrypt message **with one-time secret key**, public-key encrypted
- If **authentication** is the primary concern, a **digital signature** may suffice

---

### Federated Identity Management

- Services provided include:
  - Point of contact
  - `SSO` protocol services
  - Trust services
  - Key services
  - Identity services
  - Authorization
  - Provisioning
  - Management

#### Identity management

- `Federated identity management` uses a number of **standards** as the building blocks for secure identity exchange

- The `Extensible Markup Language (XML)`
  - A markup language that uses sets of embedded tags or labels to characterize text elements within a document so as to indicate their appearance, function, meaning, or context
- The `Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)`
  - Enables applications to request services from one another **with XML-based requests** and receive responses as data formatted with XML
- `WS-Security`
  - A set of **SOAP extensions** for implementing message integrity and confidentiality in Web services
- `Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)`
  - An **XML-based language** for the **exchange of security information** between online business partners

---

#### Personal Identity Verification

- **User authentication** based on the **possession** of a `smart card` is becoming more widespread
  - Has the appearance of a credit card
  - Has an electronic interface
  - May use a variety of authentication protocols
- A smart card contains within it an entire microprocessor, including processor, memory, and I/O ports
- A smart card includes three types of memory:
  - `Read-only memory (ROM)` stores data that does not change during the card’s life
  - `Electronically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM)` holds application data and programs; also holds data that may vary with time
  - `Random access memory (RAM)` holds temporary data generated when applications are executed

##### PIV documentation

skip

##### PIV Credentials and Keys

- `Personal Identification Number (PIN)`
  - Required to activate the card for privileged operation
- `Cardholder Unique Identifier (CHUID)`
  - Includes the Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (FASC-N) and the Global Unique Identification Number (GUID), which uniquely identify the card and the cardholder
- `PIV Authentication Key`
  - **Asymmetric key pair** and corresponding certificate for user authentication
- `Two fingerprint templates`
  - For biometric authentication
- `Electronic facial image`
  - For biometric authentication
- `Asymmetric Card Authentication Key`
  - Asymmetric key pair and corresponding certificate used for card authentication

---

##### Authentication

- Using the electronic credentials resident on a PIV card, the card supports the following **authentication mechanisms**:
- `CHUID`

  - The cardholder is **authenticated using the signed CHUID data element on the card**. The **PIN is not required**. This mechanism is useful in environments where a low level of assurance is acceptable and rapid contactless authentication is necessary

- `Card Authentication Key`

  - The PIV card is authenticated using the **Card Authentication Key** in a challenge response protocol. The **PIN is not required**.
  - This mechanism allows contact (via card reader) or contactless (via radio waves) authentication of the PIV card without the holder’s active participation, and provides a low level of assurance

- `BIO`
  - The cardholder is authenticated by matching his or her **fingerprint sample(s)** to the signed biometric data element in an environment without a human attendant in view.
  - The **PIN is required to** activate the card.
  - This mechanism achieves a high level of assurance and requires the cardholder’s active participation is submitting the PIN as well as the biometric sample
- `BIO-A`
  - The cardholder is authenticated by matching his or her **fingerprint sample(s)** to the signed biometric data element in an environment with a human attendant in view.
  - The **PIN is required** to activate the card.
  - This mechanism achieves a very high level of assurance when coupled with full trust validation of the biometric template retrieved from the card, and requires the cardholder’s active participation is submitting the PIN as well as the biometric sample
- `PKI`
  - The cardholder is authenticated by **demonstrating control of the PIV authentication private key** in a challenge response protocol that can be validated using the PIV authentication certificate.
  - The **PIN is required** to activate the card.
  - This mechanism achieves a very high level of identity assurance and requires the cardholder’s knowledge of the PIN

## Network Access Control and Cloud Security

### Network Access Control (NAC)

- An umbrella term for **managing access to a network**
  - **Authenticates** users logging into the network and **determines** what data they can **access and actions** they can perform
  - Also **examines the health** of the user’s computer or mobile device

#### Elements of a network access control system

- NAC systems deal with three categories of components:
  - `Access requester (AR)`
    - **Node that is attempting to access** the network and may be any device that is managed by the NAC system, including workstations, servers, printers, cameras, and other IP-enabled devices
    - Also referred to as supplicants, or clients
  - `Policy server`
    - Determines what access should be **granted**
    - Often relies on backend systems
  - `Network access server (NAS)`
    - Functions as an **access control point** for users in remote locations connecting to an enterprise’s internal network
    - Also called a `media gateway`, `remote access server (RAS)`, or `policy server`
    - May include its own authentication services or rely on a separate authentication service from the policy server

#### Network access enforcement methods

- The actions that are applied to ARs to **regulate access** to the enterprise network
- Many vendors support multiple enforcement methods simultaneously, allowing the customer to tailor the configuration by using one or a combination of methods

- Common NAC enforcement methods:
  - IEEE 802.1X
  - Virtual local area networks (VLANs)
  - Firewall
  - DHCP management

---

### Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

- acts as a framework for **network access and authentication** protocols.

#### Authentication Methods

- EAP provides a **generic transport service** for the exchange of authentication information between a client system and an authentication server
- The basic EAP transport service is extended by using a specific authentication protocol that is **installed in both** the EAP client and the authentication server

- Commonly supported EAP methods:
  - EAP `Transport Layer Security`
  - EAP `Tunneled TLS`
  - EAP `Generalized Pre-Shared Key`
  - EAP-`IKEv2`

---

### Cloud security as a service

- Cloud Computing
  -     “A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.”

---

#### Cloud provider (CP)

- `Cloud provider (CP)`
  - Can provide one or more of the cloud services to meet IT and business requirements of cloud consumers
    - For each of the three service models (`SaaS`, `PaaS`, `IaaS`), the CP provides the **storage** and processing facilities needed to support that service model, together with a cloud interface for cloud service consumers
    - For `SaaS`, the CP deploys, configures, maintains, and updates the operation of the **software applications** on a cloud infrastructure so that the services are provisioned at the expected service levels to cloud consumers
    - For `PaaS`, the CP manages the computing infrastructure for the **platform** and runs the cloud software that provides the components of the platform, such as runtime software execution stack, databases, and other middleware components
    - For `IaaS`, the CP acquires the **physical computing resources** underlying the service, including the servers, networks, storage, and hosting infrastructure

---

#### Roles and Responsibilities

- `Cloud carrier`
  - A **networking facility** that provides connectivity and transport of cloud services between cloud consumers and CPs
- `Cloud broker`
  - Useful when cloud services are too complex for a cloud consumer to **easily manage**
  - Three areas of support can be offered by a cloud broker:
    - **Service intermediation**
      - Value-added services such as identity management, performance reporting, and enhanced security
    - **Service aggregation**
      - The broker combines multiple cloud services to meet consumer needs not specifically addressed by a single CP, or to optimize performance or minimize cost
    - **Service arbitrage**
      - A broker has the flexibility to choose services from multiple agencies
- `Cloud auditor`
  - An independent entity that can **assure** that the CP **conforms to a set of standards**

---

### Cloud Security Risks and Countermeasures

- The `Cloud Security Alliance` [CSA10] lists the following as the top cloud specific security threats, together with suggested countermeasures:

- **Abuse and nefarious use** of cloud computing
  - **Countermeasures**: stricter initial **registration and validation** processes; enhanced credit card fraud monitoring and coordination; comprehensive introspection of customer network traffic; monitoring public blacklists for one’s own network blocks
- **Malicious insiders**

  - Countermeasures: enforce strict supply **chain management** and conduct a **comprehensive supplier assessment**; specify human resource requirements as part of legal contract; require transparency into overall information security and management practices, as well as compliance reporting; determine security breach notification processes

- **Insecure interfaces and APIs**
  - Countermeasures: analyzing the security model of CP interfaces; ensuring that strong authentication and access controls are implemented in concert with encryption machines; understanding the dependency chain associated with the API
- **Shared technology issues**
  - Countermeasures: implement security best practices for installation/configuration; monitor environment for unauthorized changes/activity; promote strong authentication and access control for administrative access and operations; enforce SLAs for patching and vulnerability remediation; conduct vulnerability scanning and configuration audits
- **Data loss or leakage**
  - Countermeasures: implement strong API access control; encrypt and protect integrity of data in transit; analyze data protection at both design and run time; implement strong key generation, storage and management, and destruction practices
- **Account or service hijacking**
  - Countermeasures: prohibit the sharing of account credentials between users and services; leverage strong two-factor authentication techniques where possible; employ proactive monitoring to detect unauthorized activity; understand CP security policies and SLAs
- **Unknown risk profile**
  - Countermeasures: disclosure of applicable logs and data; partial/full disclosure of infrastructure details; monitoring and alerting on necessary information

---

### Data Protection in the Cloud

- The threat of data compromise increases in the cloud
- Database environments used in cloud computing can vary significantly
- **Multi-instance model**
  - Provides a **unique** DBMS running **on a virtual machine instance** for each cloud subscriber
  - This gives the subscriber **complete control over role definition**, user authorization, and other administrative tasks related to security
- **Multi-tenant model**

  - Provides a predefined environment for the cloud subscriber that is **shared with other tenants**, typically through tagging data with a subscriber identifier
  - Tagging gives the appearance of exclusive use of the instance, but **relies on the CP** to establish and maintain a sound secure database environment

- Data must be **secured** while at **rest**, in **transit**, and in **use**, and access to the data must be controlled
- The client can employ **encryption** to protect data in **transit**, though this involves key management responsibilities for the CP
- For data at **rest** the ideal security measure is for the client to encrypt the database and only store encrypted data in the cloud, with the CP having no access to the encryption key
- A straightforward solution to the security problem in this context is to **encrypt the entire database** and not provide the encryption/decryption keys to the service provider
  - The user has little ability to access individual data items based on searches or indexing on key parameters
  - The user would have to download entire tables from the database, decrypt the tables, and work with the results
  - To provide more flexibility it must be possible to work with the database in its encrypted form

---

### Cloud Security as a Service (SecaaS)

- The `Cloud Security Alliance defines SecaaS` as the provision of security applications and services via the cloud either to cloud-based infrastructure and software or from the cloud to the customers’ on-premise systems
- The Cloud Security Alliance has identified the following SecaaS **categories of service**:
  - **Identity and access** management
  - Data **loss** prevention
  - **Web** security
  - **E-mail** security
  - Security **assessments**
  - **Intrusion** management
  - Security information and **event** management
  - **Encryption**
  - Business continuity and **disaster recovery**
  - **Network** security
