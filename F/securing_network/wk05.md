## Public Key Cryptography and RSA

- `Asymmetric Keys`

  - Two related keys, a **public** key and a **private** key that are used to perform complementary operations, such as **encryption** and **decryption** or **signature generation** and **signature verification**.

- `Public Key Certificate`

  - A **digital document** issued and digitally signed by the `private key` of a **Certification Authority** that binds the name of a **subscriber** to a public key.
  - The certificate indicates that the **subscriber** identified in the certificate **has sole control and access** to the corresponding `private key`.

- `Public Key (Asymmetric) Cryptographic Algorithm`

  - A cryptographic **algorithm** that **uses two** related keys, a public key and a private key.
  - The two keys have the property that **deriving** the `private key` from the `public key` is computationally **infeasible**. 私钥推导公钥不可能。

- `Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)`
  - A set of policies, processes, server platforms, software and workstations used for the purpose of **administering certificates** and **public-private key pairs**, including the ability to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates.

## Public-key Cryptosystems 公钥密码系统

- `Public-key encryption`
  - a general-purpose technique that has made symmetric encryption **obsolete**
  - **more secure** from cryptanalysis than `symmetric encryption`
    - There is a feeling that key distribution is trivial when using public-key encryption, compared to the **cumbersome handshaking** involved with key distribution centers for `symmetric encryption`

### Principles of Public-Key Cryptosystems

The concept of `public-key cryptography` evolved from an attempt to attack two of the most **difficult problems** associated with symmetric encryption:

- `Key distribution`
  - How to have secure communications in general without having to trust a KDC with your key
- `Digital signatures`

  - How to verify that a message comes intact from the claimed sender

---

- A public-key encryption scheme has six **ingredients**
  - **Plaintext**
    - The **readable message** or data that is fed into the algorithm as **input**
  - **Encryption algorithm**
    - Performs various transforma-tions on the plaintext
  - **Public key**
    - Used for encryption or decryption
  - **Private key**
    - Used for encryption or decryption
  - **Ciphertext**
    - The **scrambled message** produced as **output**
  - **Decryption algorithm**
    - Accepts the ciphertext and the matching key and produces the original plaintext

---

### Conventional vs Public-Key Encryption

- `Conventional Encryption`

  - Needed to Work:
    - 1. The **same algorithm** with the **same key** is used for encryption and decryption.
    - 2. The **sender** and **receiver** must **share** the **algorithm** and the **key**.
  - Needed for Security:
    - 1. The **key** must be kept secret.
    - 2. It must be impossible or at least **impractical to decipher** a message if the key is kept secret.
    - 3. Knowledge of the **algorithm plus samples of ciphertext** must be **insufficient** to determine the key.

- `Public-Key Encryption`

  - Needed to Work:

    - 1. One **algorithm** is used for **encryption** and a related **algorithm** for **decryption** with a pair of keys, **one** for **encryption** and **one** for **decryption**.
    - 2. The sender and receiver must each have one of the **matched pair of keys** (**not the same** one).

  - Needed for Security:
    - 1. **One** of the two keys must be kept secret.
    - 2. It must be impossible or at least **impractical to decipher** a message if one of the keys is kept secret.
    - 3. Knowledge of the **algorithm plus one of the keys** plus samples of **ciphertext** must be **insufficient** to determine the other key.

## Applications for Public-Key Cryptosystems 应用

- Public-key cryptosystems can be classified into three categories:

  - Encryption/decryption
    - The `sender` **encrypts** a message with the `recipient’s` **public key**
  - Digital signature
    - The `sender` **“signs” a message** with its **private key**
  - Key exchange
    - Two sides cooperate to **exchange** a `session key`

- Some algorithms are suitable for all three applications, whereas others can be used only for one or two

| Algorithm        | Encryption/Decryption | Digital Signature | Key Exchange |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| `RSA`            | Yes                   | Yes               | Yes          |
| `Elliptic Curve` | Yes                   | Yes               | Yes          |
| `Diffie-Hellman` | NO                    | No                | **Yes**      |
| `DSS`            | No                    | **Yes**           | No           |

## Public-Key Requirements

- Conditions that these algorithms must fulfill:
  - It is computationally easy for a party B **to generate a pair** (public-key PUb, private key PRb)
  - It is computationally easy for a **sender** A, knowing the `public key` and the message to be encrypted, **to generate the corresponding ciphertext**
  - It is computationally easy for the **receiver** B to **decrypt** the resulting ciphertext using the `private key` to recover the original message
  - It is computationally **infeasible** for an adversary, knowing the public key, **to determine** the `private key`
  - It is computationally **infeasible** for an adversary, knowing the public key and a ciphertext, **to recover the original message**
  - The two keys can be applied **in either order**

---

- Need a `trap-door one-way function`
  - A `one-way function`
    - one that maps a domain into a range such that every function value has a unique inverse, with the condition that the **calculation** of the function is **easy**, whereas the calculation of the **inverse** is **infeasible**
  - A practical `public-key scheme` depends on a suitable `trap-door one-way function`

---

## Public-key cryptanalysis 公钥密码分析

- A `public-key encryption scheme` is **vulnerable** to a **brute-force attack**
  - Countermeasure: use **large keys**
  - **Key size** must be **small enough** for practical encryption and decryption
  - Key sizes that have been proposed result in encryption/decryption speeds that are too slow for general-purpose use
  - `Public-key encryption` is currently confined to **key management** and **signature applications**
- Another form of **attack** is to find some way to **compute the `private key` given the `public key`**
  - To date it has not been mathematically proven that this form of attack is **infeasible** for a particular public-key algorithm
- Finally, there is a `probable-message attack`
  - This attack can be thwarted by appending some **random bits** to simple messages

---

## Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) Algorithm

- Developed in 1977 at MIT by **Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir & Len Adleman**
- Most widely used general-purpose approach to public-key encryption

  - Is a cipher in which the **plaintext and ciphertext are integers** between 0 and n – 1 for some n
  - A typical size for n is 1024 bits, or 309 decimal digits

- RSA makes use of an **expression with exponentials**指数

  - **Plaintext is encrypted** in **blocks** with each block having a binary value less than some number n
  - Encryption and decryption are of the following form, for some plaintext **block** M and ciphertext **block** C
    C = Me mod n
    M = Cd mod n = (Me)d mod n = Med mod n
  - **Both** sender and receiver **must know the value of n**
  - The **sender** knows the **value of e**, and only the **receiver** knows the **value of d**
  - This is a `public-key encryption algorithm` with a `public key` of PU={e,n} and a `private key` of PR={d,n}

---

### Computational aspects

- **Both encryption and decryption** in RSA involve **raising** an integer to an integer **power**, mod n
- Can make use of a property of modular arithmetic:
  `[(a mod n) x (b mod n)] mod n =(a x b) mod n`
- With RSA you are dealing with potentially **large exponents** so **efficiency of exponentiation** is a **consideration**

---

- To **speed up the operation** of the RSA algorithm using the public key, a **specific choice** of e is usually made
  - The most common choice is **65537** (216 + 1)
  - Two other popular choices are `e=3` and **`e=17`**
- Each of these choices has **only two 1 bits**, so the **number of multiplications** required to perform exponentiation is **minimized**
  - With a very **small public key**, such as `e = 3`, RSA becomes **vulnerable** to a simple **attack**

---

- **Decryption** uses exponentiation to power d
- A **small** value of d is **vulnerable** to a **brute-force attack** and to other forms of cryptanalysis
- Can use the `Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)` **to speed up computation**
  - The quantities d mod (p – 1) and d mod (q – 1) can be precalculated
- End result is that the calculation is approximately **four times as fast** as evaluating M = Cd mod n directly

---

- Before the application of the public-key cryptosystem each participant must generate a pair of keys:

  - Determine **two prime numbers** `p` and `q`
  - Select either `e` or `d` and **calculate** the other

- Because the value of n = pq will be known to any potential adversary, **primes must be chosen** from a sufficiently **large set**
- The method used for finding large primes must be reasonably **efficient**

---

### The Security of RSA

- Five possible approaches to attacking RSA are:
  - **Brute force**
    - Involves **trying all possible** `private keys`
  - **Mathematical attacks**
    - There are several approaches, all equivalent in effort to **factoring the product of two primes**
  - **Timing attacks**
    - These depend on the **running time** of the **decryption** algorithm
  - **Hardware fault-based attack**
    - This involves inducing **hardware faults** in the processor that is generating digital signatures
  - **Chosen ciphertext attacks**
    - This type of attack **exploits properties** of the RSA algorithm

---

#### Factoring Problem

- We can identify **three approaches to attacking** RSA mathematically:
  - **Factor n into its two prime factors**. This enables calculation of ø(n) = (p – 1) x (q – 1), which in turn enables determination of d = e-1 (mod ø(n))
  - **Determine ø(n) directly** without first determining p and q. Again this enables determination of d = e-1 (mod ø(n))
  - **Determine d directly** without first determining ø(n)

---

#### Timing Attacks

- Paul Kocher, a cryptographic consultant, demonstrated that a snooper can determine a private key by keeping track of how long a computer takes to decipher messages
- Are applicable **not just to RSA** but **to other public-key cryptography** systems
- Are alarming for two reasons:

  - It comes from a completely unexpected direction
  - It is a **ciphertext-only attack**

- **Countermeasures**
  - **Constant** exponentiation **time**
    - Ensure that all exponentiations **take the same amount of time** before returning a result; this is a simple fix but does degrade performance
  - **Random delay**
    - Better performance could be achieved by adding a random delay to the exponentiation algorithm to confuse the timing attack
  - **Blinding**
    - **Multiply** the ciphertext **by a random number** before performing exponentiation; this process prevents the attacker from knowing what ciphertext bits are being processed inside the computer and therefore prevents the bit-by-bit analysis essential to the timing attack

---

#### Fault-Based Attack

- An **attack on a processor** that is generating RSA digital signatures
  - Induces faults in the signature computation by reducing the power to the processor
  - The faults cause the software to **produce invalid signatures** which can then be analyzed by the attacker to recover the private key
- The attack algorithm involves inducing single-bit errors and observing the results
- While worthy of consideration, this attack does **not** appear to be a **serious threat** to RSA
  - It requires that the attacker **have physical access** to the target machine and is able to directly control the input power to the processor

---

#### Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)

- The adversary **chooses a number of ciphertexts** and is then given the corresponding plaintexts, **decrypted with the target’s** `private key`
  - Thus the adversary could select a plaintext, encrypt it with the target’s public key, and then be able to get the plaintext back by having it decrypted with the `private key`
  - The adversary **exploits properties** of RSA and selects blocks of data that, when processed using the target’s private key, yield information needed for cryptanalysis
- To **counter** such attacks, RSA Security Inc. recommends **modifying the plaintext** using a procedure known as `optimal asymmetric encryption padding (OAEP)`

---

## `Diffie-Hellman` Key Exchange

- **First** published public-key algorithm
- A number of **commercial products** employ this key exchange technique
- Purpose is to enable two users to **securely exchange a key** that can then be used for subsequent `symmetric encryption` of messages
- The algorithm itself is **limited** to the **exchange of secret values**
- Its **effectiveness** depends on the difficulty of **computing discrete** logarithms

## `ElGamal` Cryptography

- Announced in 1984 by T. Elgamal
- Public-key scheme **based on discrete logarithms** closely related to the Diffie-Hellman technique
- Used in the `digital signature standard (DSS)` and the `S/MIME e-mail` standard
- Global elements are a **prime number** q and a which is a primitive root of q
- Security is based on the difficulty of **computing discrete** logarithms

---

## Elliptic Curve Arithmetic

- Most of the products and standards that use public-key cryptography for encryption and digital signatures use RSA
- The key length for secure RSA use has increased over recent years and this has put a heavier processing load on applications using RSA
- `Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)` is showing up in standardization efforts including the `IEEE P1363 Standard` for Public-Key Cryptography
- Principal attraction of ECC is that it appears to offer equal **security** for a **far smaller key size**

- **Security** of Elliptic Curve Cryptography
  - **Depends** on the difficulty of the elliptic curve **logarithm problem**
  - Fastest known technique is “Pollard rho method”
  - Compared to factoring, can use **much smaller key sizes than** with `RSA`
  - For equivalent key lengths computations are roughly equivalent
  - Hence, for similar security ECC **offers significant computational advantages**
