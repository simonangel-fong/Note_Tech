## Secure sockets layer

- `SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)`
  - An **older** protocol that can have security flaws.
  - SSL uses a **two-step** **handshake process** to establish a secure connection.
- `TLS (Transport Layer Security)`
  - A more modern and secure version of SSL that fixes SSL's vulnerabilities.
  - TLS uses a **one-step** handshake process to establish a secure connection.

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

- `TLS`

  - Is an Internet standard that **evolved from** a commercial protocol known as **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**
  - Is a general purpose service implemented as a set of protocols that **rely on TCP**
  - Could be provided as part of the underlying protocol suite and therefore be transparent to applications
  - Can be embedded in specific packages
  - Most browsers come equipped with TLS, and most Web servers have implemented the protocol

---

### SSL architecture

- TLS **connection**
  - A transport that provides a suitable **type of service**
  - For TLS such connections are peer-to-peer relationships
  - **Connections are transient**
  - Every connection is **associated with one session**
- TLS **session**
  - An association between a **client** and a **server**
  - Created by the `Handshake Protocol`
  - Define a set of **cryptographic security parameters** which can be shared among multiple connections
  - Are used to avoid the expensive negotiation of new security parameters for each connection

---

- A session **state** is defined by the following **parameters**:

- Session identifier
  - An arbitrary byte **sequence** chosen by the server to identify an active or resumable session state
- Peer certificate
  - An `X509.v3` certificate of the peer; this element of the state may be null
- **Compression** method
  - The algorithm used to compress data prior to encryption
- Cipher spec
  - Specifies the bulk data encryption algorithm and a hash algorithm used for MAC calculation; also defines cryptographic attributes such as the hash_size
- Master secret
  48-byte secret shared between the client and the server
- Is resumable
  A flag indicating whether the session can be used to initiate new connections

---

### TLS Record Protocol

- The TLS Record Protocol provides two services for TLS connections
  - **Confidentiality**
    - The `Handshake Protocol` defines a shared secret key that is used for conventional encryption of TLS payloads
  - **Message integrity**
    - The `Handshake Protocol` also defines a shared secret key that is used to form a `message authentication code (MAC)`

### Cryptographic Computations

- Two further items are of interest:
  - The **creation** of a `shared master secret` by means of the key exchange
    - The shared master secret is a one-time 48-byte value generated for this session by means of secure key exchange
    - The creation is in two stages
      - First, a pre_master_secret is exchanged
      - Second, the master_secret is calculated by both parties
  - The generation of **cryptographic parameters** from the master secret
    - CipherSpecs require:
      - A client write MAC secret
      - A server write MAC secret
      - A client write key
      - A server write key
      - A client write IV
      - A server write IV
    - These parameters are generated from the `master secret` by hashing the master secret into a sequence of secure bytes of sufficient length for all needed parameters

---

### Heartbeat Protocol

- Is a **periodic signal** generated by hardware or software to indicate **normal operation** or to **synchronize** other parts of a system
- Typically used to monitor the availability of a protocol entity
- In the specific case of TLS, a Heartbeat protocol was defined in 2012 in RFC 6250 (Transport Layer Security (TLS) and `Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Heartbeat Extentsion`)

- Runs **on top of** the `TLS Record Protocol`
- Consists of two message **types**
  - `heartbeat_request`
  - `heartbeat_response`
- The use of the Heartbeat protocol is established during **Phase 1** of the `Handshake protocol`
- The heartbeat serves two **purposes**
  - It assures the sender that the **recipient is still alive**
  - The heartbeat generates activity across the connection during idle periods, which **avoids closure by a firewall** that does not tolerate idle connections
- The requirement for the exchange of a payload was designed into the Heartbeat protocol to support its use in a connectionless version of TLS known as `Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)`

---

### SSL/TLS Attacks

- The attacks can be grouped into four general **categories**:
  - Attacks on the `handshake protocol`
  - Attacks on the **record and application data protocols**
  - Attacks on the **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**
  - Other attacks
- The constant back-and-forth between threats and countermeasures determines the evolution of Internet-based protocols

---

### TLSv1.3

- Primary aim is to improve the security of TLS
- Significant changes from version 1.2 are:
  - TLSv1.3 removes support for a number of options and functions
- TLSv1.3 uses `Diffie-Hellman` or `Elleptic Curve Diffie-Hellman` for key exchange and **does not permit `RSA`**
- TLSv1.3 allows for a **“1 round trip time”** handshake by changing the order of message sent with establishing a secure connection

---

## HTTPS (HTTP over SSL)

- Refers to the **combination** of `HTTP` and `SSL` to implement secure communication between a Web browser and a Web server
- A user of a Web browser will see URL addresses that begin with `https://` rather than http://
- If HTTPS is specified, port `443` is used, which invokes `SSL`
- Documented in RFC 2818, HTTP Over TLS
  - There is no fundamental change in using HTTP over either SSL or TLS and both implementations are referred to as HTTPS
- When HTTPS is used, the following elements of the communication are encrypted:
  - **URL** of the requested document
  - Contents of the **document**
  - Contents of **browser forms**
  - **Cookies** sent from browser to server and from server to browser
  - Contents of **HTTP header**

---

### Connection Initiation

- For HTTPS, the agent acting as the HTTP client also acts as the TLS client

  - The client initiates a connection to the server on the appropriate port and then sends the `TLS ClientHello` to **begin** the TLS handshake
  - When the TLS handshake has finished, the client may then initiate the first HTTP request
  - All HTTP data is to be sent as TLS application data

- There are **three levels** of awareness of a connection in HTTPS:
  - At the `HTTP` level, an HTTP client requests a connection to an HTTP server by sending a connection **request to the next lowest layer**
    - Typically the next lowest layer is `TCP`, but is may also be TLS/SSL
  - At the level of `TLS`, a **session is established** between a TLS client and a TLS server
    - This session can support one or more connections at any time
  - A `TLS` request to **establish a connection** begins with the establishment of a TCP connection between the TCP entity on the client side and the TCP entity on the server side

---

### Connection Closure

- An HTTP client or server can **indicate the closing** of a connection by including the line `Connection: close` in an HTTP record
- The closure of an HTTPS connection requires that `TLS` **close** the connection with the **peer** `TLS entity` on the remote side, which will involve closing the underlying TCP connection
- TLS implementations must initiate an **exchange of closure alerts** before closing a connection
  - A TLS implementation may, after sending a closure alert, close the connection **without waiting for the peer** to send its closure alert, generating an “`incomplete close`”
- An **unannounced TCP closure** could be evidence of some sort of **attack** so the HTTPS client should issue some sort of security warning when this occurs

---

## Secure Shell (SSH)

- The initial version, SSH1 was focused on providing a secure remote logon facility to **replace** `TELNET` and other remote logon schemes that provided no security
- SSH also provides a more general client/server capability and can be used for such network functions as file transfer and e-mail
- `SSH2` fixes a number of security flaws in the original scheme and is documented as a proposed standard in IETF RFCs 4250 through 4256
- SSH client and server applications are widely available for most operating systems
  - Has become the method of choice for remote login and X tunneling
  - Is rapidly becoming one of the most pervasive applications for encryption technology outside of embedded systems

---

### Transport Layer Protocol

- Server **authentication** occurs at the `transport layer`, based on the server possessing a **public/private key pair**
- A server may have **multiple** `host keys` using multiple different `asymmetric encryption algorithms`
- Multiple hosts may share the **same** `host key`
- The `server host key` is used during **key exchange to authenticate** the identity of the host
- RFC 4251 dictates two alternative trust models:
  - The **client** has a `local database` that associates each `host name` with the corresponding `public host key`
  - The host name-to-key association is **certified** by a trusted `certification authority (CA)`; the client only knows the `CA root key` and can **verify** the validity of all host keys certified by accepted CAs

---

### Authentication Methods

- **Publickey**
  - The client sends a message to the server that **contains the client’s `public key`**, with the message signed by the client’s `private key`
  - When the server receives this message, it checks whether the supplied key is acceptable for authentication and, if so, it checks whether the signature is correct
- **Password**
  - The client sends a message containing a **plaintext password**, which is protected by **encryption** by the `Transport Layer Protocol`
- **Hostbased**
  - **Authentication** is performed on the **client’s host** rather than the client itself
  - This method works by having the client **send a signature** created with the `private key` of the client host
  - Rather than directly verifying the user’s identity, the SSH server verifies the **identity of the client host**

---

### Connection Protocol

- The `SSH Connection Protocol` runs on top of the `SSH Transport Layer Protocol` and assumes that a secure authentication connection is in use
  - The **secure authentication connection**, referred to as a `tunnel`, is used by the Connection Protocol to multiplex a number of logical channels
- Channel mechanism
  - All types of communication using SSH are supported using separate channels
  - Either side may open a channel
  - For each channel, each side associates a unique channel number
  - Channels are flow controlled using a window mechanism
  - No data may be sent to a channel until a message is received to indicate that window space is available
  - The life of a channel progresses through three stages: **opening** a channel, data **transfer**, and **closing** a channel

---

### Channel Types

- Four channel types are recognized in the SSH Connection Protocol specification

- **Session**
  - The remote execution of a program
  - The program may be a shell, an application such as file transfer or e-mail, a system command, or some built-in subsystem
  - Once a session channel is opened, subsequent requests are used to start the remote program
- **X11**
  - Refers to the **X Window System**, a computer software system and network protocol that provides a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for networked computers
  - X allows applications to run on a network server but to be **displayed** on a desktop machine
- **Forwarded-tcpip**
  - **Remote** **port forwarding**
- **Direct-tcpip**
  - **Local** port forwarding

---

### Port Forwarding

- One of the most useful features of SSH
- Provides the ability to **convert** any **insecure** `TCP` connection **into a secure** `SSH` connection (also referred to as `SSH tunneling`)
- Incoming TCP traffic is delivered to the appropriate application on the basis of the port number (a port is an identifier of a user of TCP)
- An application may employ multiple port numbers

---

## Wireless Network Security

### Wireless Security

- **Channel**
  - Wireless networking typically **involves broadcast communications**, which is far more susceptible to eavesdropping and jamming than wired networks
  - Wireless networks are also more **vulnerable to active attacks** that exploit vulnerabilities in communications protocols
- **Mobility**
  - Wireless devices are far more **portable** and mobile than wired devices
  - This mobility results in a number of risks
- **Resources**
  - Some wireless devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have sophisticated operating systems but limited memory and processing resources with which to counter threats, including denial of service and malware
- **Accessibility**
  - Some wireless devices, such as sensors and robots, may be left unattended in remote and/or hostile locations
  - This greatly increases their vulnerability to physical attacks

### Wireless Network Threats

- **Accidental association**
  - Company wireless LANs in close proximity may create overlapping transmission ranges
  - A user intending to connect to one LAN may unintentionally lock on to a wireless access point from a neighboring network
- **Malicious association**
  - In this situation, a wireless device is configured to appear to be a legitimate access point, enabling the operator to steal passwords from legitimate users and then penetrate a wired network through a legitimate wireless access point
- **Ad hoc networks**
  - These are peer-to-peer networks between wireless computers with no access point between them
  - Such networks can pose a security threat due to a lack of a central point of control
- **Nontraditional networks**

  - Personal network Bluetooth devices, barcode readers, and handheld PDAs pose a security risk in terms of both eavesdropping and spoofing

- **Identity theft (MAC spoofing)**
  - This occurs when an attacker is able to **eavesdrop** on network traffic and identify the MAC address of a computer with network privileges
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks**
  - This attack involves persuading a user and an access point to believe that they are talking to each other when in fact the communication is going through an intermediate attacking device
  - Wireless networks are particularly vulnerable to such attacks
- **Denial of service (DoS)**
  - This attack occurs when an attacker continually bombards a wireless access point or some other accessible wireless port with various protocol messages designed to consume system resources
  - The wireless environment lends itself to this type of attack because it is so easy for the attacker to direct multiple wireless messages at the target
- **Network injection**
  - This attack targets wireless access points that are exposed to nonfiltered network traffic, such as routing protocol messages or network management messages

---

### Securing Wireless Transmissions

- The principal threats to wireless transmission are **eavesdropping**, **altering** or **inserting** messages, and disruption
- To deal with **eavesdropping**, two types of countermeasures are appropriate:
  - **Signal-hiding techniques**
    - Turn off **SSID broadcasting** by wireless access points
    - Assign cryptic names to SSIDs
    - Reduce signal s**trength to the lowest level** that still provides requisite coverage
    - Locate wireless access points in the interior of the building, away from windows and exterior walls
  - **Encryption**
    - Is effective against eavesdropping to the extent that the encryption keys are secured

### Securing Wireless Access Points

- The main threat involving wireless access points is **unauthorized access** to the network
- The principal approach for preventing such access is the `IEEE 802.1x standard` for port-based network access control
  - The standard provides an authentication mechanism for devices wishing to attach to a LAN or wireless network
  - The use of 802.1x can prevent rogue access points and other unauthorized devices from becoming insecure backdoors

### Securing Wireless Networks

- Use encryption
- Use antivirus, antispyware software and a firewall
- Turn off identifier broadcasting
- Change the identifier on your router from the default
- Change your router’s pre-set password for administration
- Allow only specific computers to access your wireless network

---

## Mobile Device Security

### Security Threats

- **Lack of physical security controls**
  - The security policy for mobile devices must be based on the assumption that any mobile device may be **stolen or at least accessed** by a malicious party
- Use of **untrusted mobile devices**
  - The organization must assume that not all devices are trustworthy
- Use of **untrusted networks**
  - The security policy must be based on the assumption that the networks between the mobile device and the organization are not trustworthy
- Use of **untrusted content**

  - Mobile devices may access and use content that other computing devices do not encounter

- Use of **applications** created by unknown parties
  - It is easy to find and install third-party applications on mobile devices and this poses the risk of installing malicious software
- **Interaction with other systems**
  - Unless an organization has control of all the devices involved in synchronization, there is considerable risk of the organization’s data being stored in an unsecured location, plus the risk of the introduction of malware
- Use of **location services**
  - An attacker can use location information to determine where the device and user are located, which may be of use to the attacker

---

## IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN Overview

- `IEEE 802` is a **committee** that has developed standards for a wide range of local area networks (LANs)
- In 1990 the IEEE 802 Committee formed a new working group, `IEEE 802.11`, with a charter to develop a protocol and transmission specifications for wireless LANs (WLANs)
- Since that time, the demand for WLANs at different frequencies and data rates has exploded

### Wi-Fi Alliance

- The first 802.11 standard to gain broad industry acceptance was 802.11b
- `Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA)`
  - An industry consortium formed in 1999
  - Subsequently renamed the `Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) Alliance`
  - Created a test suite to certify interoperability for 802.11 products
- `Wi-Fi`
  - The term used for certified **802.11b products**
  - Has been extended to 802.11g products
- `Wi-Fi5`
  - A certification process for 802.11a products that was developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance
  - Recently the Wi-Fi Alliance has developed certification procedures for IEEE 802.11 security standards
  - Referred to as `Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)`

### IEEE 802.11 services

- `Basic service set(BSS)`

  - A set of stations controlled by a single coordination function.

- `Distribution system(DS)`
  - A system used to interconnect a set of BSSs and integrated LANs to create an ESS.
- `Extended service set(ESS)`

  - A set of one or more interconnected BSSs and integrated LANs that appear as a single BSS to the LLC layer at any station associated with one of these BSSs.

- **No transition**
  - A station of this type is either stationary or moves only within the direct communication range of the communicating stations of a single `BSS`
- **BSS transition**
  - This is defined as a station movement from one BSS to another BSS within the **same ESS**
  - In this case, delivery of data to the station requires that the addressing capability be able to recognize the new location of the station
- **ESS transition**
  - This is defined as a station movement from a BSS in one ESS to a BSS **within another ESS**
  - Maintenance of upper-layer connections supported by 802.11 cannot be guaranteed
  - Disruption of service is likely to occur

---

## IEEE 802.11i Wireless LAN Security

- wireless security protocols

- `Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)`
  - The **privacy portion** of the 802.11 standard
  - Contained major weaknesses
- `Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)`

  - A set of security mechanisms that eliminates most 802.11 security issues
  - Based on the current state of the 802.11i standard

- `Robust Security Network (RSN)`
  - Final form of the 802.11i standard
  - Complex

---

### IEEE 802.1X Access Control Approach

- **Port-Based** Network Access Control
  - The authentication protocol that is used, the `Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)`, is defined in the `IEEE 802.1X` standard
- `802.1X` uses:
  - **Controlled ports**
    - Allows the exchange of PDUs between a supplicant and other systems on the LAN only if the current state of the supplicant authorizes such an exchange
  - **Uncontrolled ports**
    - Allows the exchange of PDUs between the supplicant and the other AS, regardless of the authentication state of the supplicant

### Pairwise Keys

- Used for communication between a pair of devices, typically between a `STA` and an `AP`
- These keys form a hierarchy beginning with a master key from which other keys are derived dynamically and used for a limited period of time
- `Pre-shared key (PSK)`
  - A secret key **shared** by the `AP` and a `STA` and installed in some fashion outside the scope of IEEE 802.11i
- `Master session key (MSK)`
  - Also known as the `AAAK`, and is generated using the IEEE 802.1X protocol **during the authentication phase**
- `Pairwise master key (PMK)`
  - Derived from the master key
  - If a PSK is used, then the PSK is used as the PMK; if a MSK is used, then the PMK is derived from the MSK by truncation
- `Pairwise transient key (PTK)`
  - Consists of three keys to be used for communication between a STA and AP after they have been mutually authenticated
  - Using the STA and AP addresses in the generation of the PTK provides protection against session hijacking and impersonation; using nonces provides additional random keying material

### Group Keys

- Group keys are used for **multicast communication** in which one STA sends MPDUs to multiple STAs
  - `Group master key (GMK)`
    - Key-generating key used with other inputs to derive the GTK
  - `Group temporal key (GTK)`
    - Generated by the AP and transmitted to its associated STAs
    - IEEE 802.11i requires that its value is computationally indistinguishable from random
    - Distributed securely using the pairwise keys that are already established
    - Is changed every **time a device leaves** the network

### Protected Data Transfer Phase

- IEEE 802.11i defines **two schemes for protecting data** transmitted in 802.11 MPDUs:
- `Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)`
  - Designed to require only software changes to devices that are implemented with WEP
  - Provides two services:
    - Message integrity
    - Data confidentiality
- `Counter Mode-CBC MAC Protocol (CCMP)`
  - Intended for newer IEEE 802.11 devices that are equipped with the hardware to support this scheme
  - Provides two services:
    - Message integrity
    - Data confidentiality

---

### IEEE 802.11i Pseudorandom Function (PRF)

- Used at a number of places in the IEEE 802.11i scheme (to generate nonces, to expand pairwise keys, to generate the GTK)
- Best security practice dictates that different pseudorandom number streams be used for these different purposes
- Built on the use of HMAC-SHA-1 to **generate a pseudorandom bit stream**
