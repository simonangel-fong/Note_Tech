## Cryptographic hash functions

- `hash function`
  - accepts a **variable-length block of data** as input and **produces** a **fixed-size hash value**
  - Principal object is **data integrity**
- `Cryptographic hash function`
  An **algorithm** for which it is computationally **infeasible** to find either:

  - a **data object** that maps to a pre-specified hash result (the **one-way property**)
  - **two data objects** that map to the **same** hash result (the **collision-free property**)

- `Message authentication`

  - a mechanism or service used to **verify the integrity** of a message.
  - assures that **data received** are exactly **as sent**

- In many cases, there is a requirement that the authentication mechanism **assures** that purported **identity of the sender** is valid.
  - When a hash function is used to provide message authentication, the `hash function value` is often referred to as a `message digest`.

---

### Message Authentication Code (MAC)

- `Message Authentication Code (MAC)`

  - aka `keyed hash function`
  - used between two parties that **share a secret key** to **authenticate information** exchanged between those parties

- Takes as input a `secret key` and a `data block` and **produces** a `hash value (MAC)` which is associated with the protected message
  - If the integrity of the message needs to be checked, the MAC function can be applied to the message and the result compared with the associated MAC value
  - An **attacker** who alters the message will be **unable to alter** the associated `MAC value` without knowledge of the `secret key`

---

### Digital Signature

- `Digital Signature`
  - Operation is **similar** to that of the `MAC`
  - The hash value of a message is **encrypted** with a user’s `private key`
  - Anyone who knows the user’s **public key** can **verify the integrity** of the message
- An attacker who wishes to **alter** the message would **need to know the user’s** `private key`
- Implications of digital signatures **go beyond** just **message authentication**

---

### Other Hash Function Uses

- Commonly used to **create** a `one-way password file`
  - When a user enters a password, the **hash of that password** is **compared** to the **stored hash value for verification**
  - This approach to password protection is used by most operating systems
- Can be used for **intrusion and virus detection**
  - Store H(F) for each file on a system and secure the hash values
  - One can later **determine if a file has been modified** by recomputing H(F)
  - An intruder would need to change F without changing H(F)
- Can be used to construct a `pseudorandom function (PRF)` or a `pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)`
  - A common application for a hash-based PRF is for the generation of `symmetric keys`

---

### Two Simple Hash Functions

- Consider two simple insecure hash functions that operate using the following general principles:
  - The input is viewed as a sequence of n-bit blocks
  - The input is processed one block at a time in an iterative fashion to produce an n-bit hash function
- Bit-by-bit exclusive-OR (XOR) of every block
  - Ci = bi1 xor bi2 xor . . . xor bim
  - Produces a simple parity for each bit position and is known as a longitudinal redundancy check
  - Reasonably effective for random data as a data integrity check
- Perform a one-bit circular shift on the hash value after each block is processed
  - Has the effect of randomizing the input more completely and overcoming any regularities that appear in the input

---

## Requirements for a Cryptographic Hash Function H

- Requirement
- **Variable input size**
  - H can be applied to a **block of data of any size**.
- **Fixed output size**
  - H produces **a fixed-length output**.
- Efficiency
  - H(x) is **relatively easy to compute** for any given x, making both hardware and software implementations practical.
- **Preimage resistant** (one-way property)
  - For any given hash value h, it is computationally **infeasible to find y** such that H(y) = h.
- **Second preimage resistant** (weak collision resistant)
  - For any given block x, it is computationally **infeasible to find y # x** with H(y) = H(x).
- **Collision resistant** (strong collision resistant)
  - It is computationally **infeasible to find any pair (x, y)** such that H(x) = H(y).
- **Pseudorandomness**
  - Output of H meets **standard tests for pseudorandomness**

---

### Attacks on Hash Functions

- **Brute-Force Attacks**

  - Does not depend on the specific algorithm, **only depends on bit length**
  - In the case of a hash function, attack depends **only on the bit length** of the hash value
  - Method is to pick values at random and try each one **until a collision occurs**

- **Cryptanalysis**
  - An attack based on **weaknesses** in a particular cryptographic **algorithm**
  - Seek to **exploit some property of the algorithm** to perform some attack other than an exhaustive search

---

- **Collision Resistant Attacks**
- For a collision resistant attack, an adversary wishes to **find two messages or data blocks** that **yield the same hash function**

  - The effort required is explained by a mathematical result referred to as the `birthday paradox`

- Yuval proposed the following **strategy** to exploit the `birthday paradox` in a `collision resistant attack`:
  - The source (A) is prepared to sign a legitimate message x by appending the appropriate m-bit hash code and encrypting that hash code with A’s private key
  - Opponent generates 2m/2 variations x’ of x, all with essentially the same meaning, and stores the messages and their hash values
  - Opponent prepares a fraudulent message y for which A’s signature is desired
  - Opponent generates minor variations y’ of y, all of which convey essentially the same meaning. For each y’, the opponent computes H (y’), checks for matches with any of the H (x’) values, and continues until a match is found. That is, the process continues until a y’ is generated with a hash value equal to the hash value of one of the x’ values
  - The opponent offers the valid variation to A for signature which can then be attached to the fraudulent variation for transmission to the intended recipient
- Because the two variations have the same hash code, they will produce the same signature and the opponent is assured of success even though the encryption key is not known

---

## Hash Functions Based on Cipher Block Chaining

- A number of proposals have been made for hash functions based on using a cipher block chaining technique, but **without using the secret key**
- One of the first proposals was that of **Rabin**

  - Divide a message M into fixed-size blocks M1, M2, . . . , MN and use a symmetric encryption system such as DES to compute the hash code G as
  - Similar to the CBC technique, but in this case, there is **no secret key**
  - As with any hash code, this scheme is subject to the birthday attack
  - If the encryption algorithm is `DES` and **only a 64-bit hash code** is produced, the system is **vulnerable**

- **Meet-in-the-middle-attack**
  - Another version of the birthday attack used even if the opponent has access to only one message and its valid signature and cannot obtain multiple signings
- It can be shown that some form of birthday attack will succeed against any hash scheme involving the use of cipher block chaining without a secret key, provided that either the resulting hash code is small enough or that a larger hash code can be decomposed into independent subcodes

---

## Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)

- SHA was originally designed by the `National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)` and published as a `federal information processing standard (FIPS 180)` in 1993
- Was revised in 1995 as SHA-1
- Based on the **hash function MD4** and its design closely models MD4
- Produces **160-bit** hash values
- In 2002 NIST produced a revised version of the standard that defined three new versions of SHA with hash value lengths of **256**, **384**, and **512**
- Collectively known as `SHA-2`

---

### SHA-3

- `SHA-1` has **not** yet been "**broken”**
  - No one has demonstrated a technique for producing collisions in a practical amount of time
  - Considered to be insecure and has been phased out for SHA-2
- `SHA-2` shares the **same structure and mathematical operations** as its predecessors so this is a cause for concern
  - Because it will take years to find a suitable replacement for SHA-2 should it become vulnerable, NIST decided to begin the process of developing a new hash standard
- NIST announced in 2007 a competition for the `SHA-3` **next generation** NIST hash function
  - Winning design was announced by NIST in October 2012
  - `SHA-3` is a **cryptographic hash function** that is intended to complement SHA-2 as the approved standard for a wide range of applications

---

### The Sponge Construction

- **Underlying structure** of `SHA-3` is a **scheme** referred to by its designers as a `sponge construction`
- Takes an input message and **partitions it into fixed-size blocks**
- Each block is processed in turn with the output of each iteration fed into the next iteration, finally producing an output block
- The sponge function is defined by **three parameters**:
  f = the **internal function** used to process each input block
  r = the **size in bits** of the input blocks, called the bitrate
  pad = the **padding algorithm**

---

## Message Authentication Codes

### Attacks

- **Disclosure**
  - Release of message contents to any person or process **not possessing the appropriate cryptographic key**
- **Traffic analysis**
  - Discovery of the **pattern of traffic** between parties
- **Masquerade**
  - Insertion of messages into the network from a fraudulent source
- **Content modification**
  - Changes to the contents of a message, including insertion, deletion, transposition, and modification
- **Sequence modification**
  - Any **modification to a sequence** of messages between parties, including insertion, deletion, and reordering
- **Timing modification**
  - **Delay** or **replay** of messages
- **Source repudiation**
  - **Denial of transmission** of message by source
- **Destination repudiation**
  - **Denial of receipt** of message by destination

---

### Message Authentication Functions

- `Hash function`
  - A function that **maps** a message of **any length** into a **fixed-length hash value** which serves as the authenticator
- `Message encryption`
  - The **ciphertext** of the entire message **serves as its authenticator**
- `Message authentication code (MAC)`

  - A **function** of the message and a **secret key** that produces a fixed-length value that **serves as the authenticator**

- Two levels of functionality:

  - Lower level
    - There must be some sort of function that **produces an authenticator**
  - Higher-level
    - Uses the lower-level function as a primitive in an authentication protocol that **enables a receiver to verify the authenticity of a message**

- `Public-Key Encryption`

  - The straightforward use of public-key encryption provides **confidentiality but not authentication**

- To provide both confidentiality and authentication, A can **encrypt** M **first** using its `private key` which provides the `digital signature`, and then using B’s `public key`, which provides **confidentiality**
  - Disadvantage is that the public-key **algorithm** must be **exercised four times** rather than two in each communication

---

### Requirements for MACs

- Taking into account the types of attacks, the MAC needs to satisfy the following:
  - The first requirement deals with `message replacement attacks`, in which an opponent is able to **construct a new message** to **match a given MAC**, even though the opponent does not know and does not learn the key
  - The second requirement deals with the need to thwart a `brute-force attack` based on **chosen plaintext**
  - The final requirement dictates that the `authentication algorithm` should **not be weaker** with respect to certain parts or bits of the message than others

---

#### Brute-Force Attack

- A `brute-force attack on a MAC` is a more difficult undertaking than a `brute-force attack on a hash function` because it **requires** known **message-tag pairs**.

#### Cryptanalysis

- Cryptanalytic attacks seek to **exploit some property of the algorithm** to perform some attack other than an exhaustive search
- An ideal MAC algorithm will require a cryptanalytic **effort greater** than or equal to the `brute-force effort`
- There is much **more** variety in the **structure of MACs** than in hash functions, so it is difficult to generalize about the cryptanalysis of MACs

---

## MACs Based on Hash Functions: HMAC

- There has been increased interest in developing a MAC derived from a cryptographic hash function
- Motivations:
  - `Cryptographic hash functions` such as `MD5` and `SHA` generally execute faster in software than symmetric block ciphers such as `DES`
- Library code for cryptographic hash functions is widely available
- `HMAC` has been chosen as the **mandatory-to-implement MAC for IP security**
- Has also been issued as a NIST standard (FIPS 198)

- HMAC Design Objectives
- RFC 2104 lists the following objectives for HMAC:
  - To use, without modifications, available hash functions
  - To allow for easy replaceability of the embedded hash function in case faster or more secure hash functions are found or required
  - To preserve the original performance of the hash function without incurring a significant degradation
  - To use and handle keys in a simple way
  - To have a well understood cryptographic analysis of the strength of the authentication mechanism based on reasonable assumptions about the embedded hash function

---

### Security of HMAC

- Depends in some way on the **cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function**
- Appeal of HMAC is that its designers have been able to prove an **exact relationship** between the strength of the **embedded hash function** and the strength of **HMAC**
- Generally expressed in terms of the **probability of successful forgery** with a given **amount of time** spent by the forger and a given number of **message-tag pairs** created with the same key

---

- `Data Authentication Algorithm  (DAA)`, based on `DES`, has been one of the most widely used MACs for a number of years.
  - DAA has been widely adopted in **government** and **industry**.

---

## Authenticated Encryption (AE)

- A term used to **describe encryption systems** that simultaneously protect **confidentiality** and **authenticity** of communications
- Approaches:
  - **Hashing followed** by encryption
  - **Authentication followed** by encryption
  - **Encryption followed** by authentication
  - **Independently** encrypt and authenticate
- Both decryption and verification are straightforward for each approach
- There are security **vulnerabilities** with all of these approaches

---

### Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code (CCM)

- Was standardized by NIST specifically to support the security requirements of IEEE 802.11 WiFi wireless local area networks
- Variation of the encrypt-and-MAC approach to authenticated encryption
  - Defined in NIST SP 800-38C
- Key algorithmic ingredients:
  - AES encryption algorithm
  - CTR mode of operation
  - CMAC authentication algorithm
- Single key K is used for both encryption and MAC algorithms

---

- The **input** to the `CCM` encryption process consists of **three elements**:
  - Data that will be **both authenticated and encrypted**
    - This is the plaintext message P of the data block
  - Associated data A that will be **authenticated but not encrypted**
    - An example is a protocol header that must be transmitted in the clear for proper protocol operation but which needs to be authenticated
  - A `nonce N` that is **assigned** to the payload and the associated data
    - This is a unique value that is different for every instance during the lifetime of a protocol association and is intended to prevent replay attacks and certain other types of attacks

---

### Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)

- NIST standard SP 800-38D
- Designed to be **parallelizable** so that it can **provide high throughput** with low cost and low latency
  - Message is **encrypted** in variant of CTR mode
  - Resulting ciphertext is multiplied with key material and message length information over GF (2128) to generate the authenticator tag
  - The standard also specifies a mode of operation that supplies the MAC only, known as GMAC
- Makes use of two functions:
  - `GHASH` - a keyed hash function
  - `GCTR` - CTR mode with the counters determined by simple increment by one operation

---

### Key Wrap (KW)

- Most recent **block cipher mode** of operation defined by NIST
- Uses `AES` or `triple DEA` as the underlying encryption algorithm
- Purpose is to **securely exchange** a `symmetric key` to be shared by two parties, using a symmetric key already shared by those parties
- The latter key is called a `key encryption key (KEK)`
- Robust in the sense that each bit of output can be expected to depend in a nontrivial fashion on each bit of input
- Only used for **small amounts of plaintext**

---

### Pseudorandom Number Generation Using Hash Functions and MACs

- Essential elements of any `pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)` are a seed value and a deterministic algorithm for generating a stream of pseudorandom bits
- If the algorithm is used as a `pseudorandom function (PRF) `to produce a required value, the seed should only be known to the user of the PRF
- If the algorithm is used to produce a stream encryption function, the seed has the role of a secret key that must be known to the sender and the receiver
- A hash function or MAC produces apparently random output and **can be used to build a PRNG**

---

## Digital Signatures

- Digital Signature Properties
  - It must verify the **author** and the **date** and **time** of the **signature**
  - It must **authenticate the contents** at the time of the signature
  - It must be **verifiable by third parties** to resolve disputes

---

### Attacks

- **Key-only attack**
  - C only knows A’s **public key**
- **Known message attack**
  - C is given access to a set of **messages** and their **signatures**
- **Generic chosen message attack**
  - C chooses a **list of messages** before attempting to break A’s signature scheme, independent of A’s public key; C then obtains from A valid signatures for the chosen messages
- **Directed chosen message attack**
  - Similar to the generic attack, except that the list of messages to be signed **is chosen** after C knows A’s public key but before any signatures are seen
- **Adaptive chosen message attack**
  - C may request from A signatures of messages that **depend on previously obtained message-signature pairs**

### Forgeries

- **Total break**
  - C determines A’s `private key`
- **Universal forgery**
  - C finds an efficient signing **algorithm** that provides an equivalent way of constructing signatures on arbitrary messages
- **Selective forgery**
  - C forges a signature **for a particular message** chosen by C
- **Existential forgery**
  - C forges a signature for **at least one message**; C has no control over the message

---

### Digital Signature Requirements

- The signature must be a bit pattern that **depends on the message** being signed
- The signature must use some **information unique to the sender** to prevent both forgery and denial
- It must be relatively **easy to produce** the digital signature
- It must be relatively **easy to recognize and verify** the digital signature
- It must be computationally **infeasible to forge** a digital signature, either by constructing a new message for an existing digital signature or by constructing a fraudulent digital signature for a given message
- It must be **practical to retain a copy** of the digital signature in storage

---

### Direct Digital Signature

- Refers to a digital signature scheme that **involves only the communicating parties**
  - It is assumed that the **destination knows the public key of the source**
- **Confidentiality** can be provided by encrypting the entire message plus signature **with a shared secret key**
  - It is important to perform the signature function first and then an outer confidentiality function
  - In case of dispute some third party must view the message and its signature
- The **validity** of the scheme depends on the security of the sender’s `private key`
  - If a sender later wishes to deny sending a particular message, the sender can claim that the private key was lost or stolen and that someone else forged his or her signature
  - One way to thwart or at least weaken this ploy is to require every signed message to include a timestamp and to require prompt reporting of compromised keys to a central authority

---

## `ElGamal` Digital Signature

- Scheme involves the use of the `private key` for **encryption** and the `public key` for **decryption**
- Global elements are a **prime number** q and a, which is a primitive root of q
- Use `private key` for **encryption** (signing)
- Uses `public key` for **decryption** (verification)
- Each user generates their key
  - Chooses a secret key (number): 1 < xA < q-1
  - Compute their public key: yA = axA mod q

## `Schnorr` Digital Signature

- Scheme is based on **discrete logarithms**
  - **Minimizes** the message-dependent amount of **computation** required to generate a signature
- Multiplying a 2n-bit integer with an n-bit integer
- Main work can be done during the **idle time of the processor**
- Based on using a prime modulus p, with p – 1 having a prime factor q of appropriate size
  - Typically p is a 1024-bit number, and q is a 160-bit number

---

## NIST Digital Signature Algorithm

- Published by NIST as Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS 186
- Makes use of the `Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)`
- The latest version, FIPS 186-3, also incorporates digital signature algorithms based on RSA and on elliptic curve cryptography

---

## Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

- Four elements are involved:
  - All those participating in the digital signature scheme use the same global domain parameters, which define an elliptic curve and a point of origin on the curve
  - A signer must first generate a public, private key pair
  - A hash value is generated for the message to be signed; using the private key, the domain parameters, and the hash value, a signature is generated
  - To verify the signature, the verifier uses as input the signer’s public key, the domain parameters, and the integer s; the output is a value v that is compared to r ; the signature is verified if the v = r

---

## RSA-PSS

- `RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme`
- Included in the 2009 version of FIPS 186
- Latest of the RSA schemes and the one that RSA Laboratories recommends as the most secure of the RSA schemes
- For all schemes developed prior to PSS it has not been possible to develop a mathematical proof that the signature scheme is as secure as the underlying RSA encryption/decryption primitive
- The PSS approach was first proposed by Bellare and Rogaway
- This approach, unlike the other RSA-based schemes, introduces a randomization process that enables the security of the method to be shown to be closely related to the security of the RSA algorithm itself

- **Mask Generation Function (MGF)**
  - Typically based on a secure cryptographic hash function such as `SHA-1`
  - Is intended to be a cryptographically secure way of generating a message digest, or hash, of variable length based on an underlying cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-length output
