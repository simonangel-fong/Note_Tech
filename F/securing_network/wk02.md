### symmetric encryption scheme

- A symmetric encryption scheme: 5
  - **Plaintext** (inpu)
  - **Encryption algorithm**
    - performs various substitutions and transformations on the plaintext.替代与转换
  - **Secret key**:
    - also input to the encryption algorithm.
    - The key is a **value independent** of the plaintext and of the algorithm.
    - The algorithm will produce a different output depending on the specific key being used at the time.
  - **Ciphertext**
    - scrambled message produced as output
    - depends on the **plaintext** and the **secret key**
  - **Decryption algorithm**
    - takes the **ciphertext** and the **secret key** and produces the **original plaintext**.

---

### Symmetric Cipher Model

- two requirements
  - strong encryption **algorithm**
  - **Sender and receiver** must have obtained **copies of the secret key** in a secure fashion and must keep the key secure.

---

### Cryptographic systems

- Cryptographic systems three independent dimensions

  - **operations** used for **transforming plaintext to ciphertext**.
    - 2 types:
      - **substitution**
        - each element in the plaintext is mapped into another element
      - **transposition**,
        - in which elements in the plaintext are **rearranged**.
  - **The number of keys used**

    - **symmetric / secret-key / single-key / conventional**:
      - sender and receiver use the **same** key
    - **asymmetric / two-key / public-key**:
      - sender and receiver use **different** keys

  - The way in which the **plaintext is processed**
    - **block cipher**
      - processes the input **one block** of elements **at a time**, producing **an output block for each input block**.
    - **stream cipher**
      - processes the **input elements continuously**, producing output **one element at a time**, as it goes along.

---

### attacking a conventional encryption scheme

- 2 general approaches

- **Cryptanalysis**:

  - Cryptanalytic attacks **rely on** the nature of the **algorithm** plus perhaps some knowledge of the general characteristics of the **plaintext** or even some sample plaintext–ciphertext pairs.
  - attempt to deduce a specific plaintext / key
  - **Brute-force attack:**
    - The attacker **tries every possible key** on a piece of ciphertext until an intelligible translation into plaintext is obtained.
    - On average, **half** of all possible keys must be tried to achieve success.

- If either type of attack succeeds in **deducing the key**, the effect is catastrophic:
  - All future and past messages encrypted with that key are compromised.

---

### Encryption Scheme Security

- **Unconditionally** secure

  - No matter how much time an opponent has, it is **impossible** for him or her to decrypt the ciphertext simply because the required information is not there

- **Computationally** secure
  - The **cost** of breaking the cipher **exceeds** the **value** of the encrypted information
  - The **time** required to break the cipher **exceeds** the useful **lifetime** of the information

---

### Brute-Force Attack

- `brute-force attack`
  - involves **trying every possible key** until an intelligible translation of the ciphertext into plaintext is obtained.
  - On average, **half** of all possible keys must be tried to achieve success.
    - That is, if there are **X** different keys, on **average** an attacker would discover the actual key after **X/2 tries**.
    - To supplement the brute-force approach, some degree of knowledge about the **expected plaintext** is needed, and some means of automatically **distinguishing plaintext** from garble is also needed

---

### Substitution Technique

- `substitution technique`
  - one in which the **letters** of plaintext are **replaced** by other letters or by numbers or symbols.
  - If the plaintext is viewed as a sequence of **bits**, then substitution involves replacing plaintext **bit patterns** with ciphertext **bit patterns**.

---

#### Caesar Cipher

- `Caesar Cipher`
  - The **earliest** known, and the **simplest**, use of a substitution cipher was by **Julius Caesar.**
- involves **replacing** each letter of the alphabet with the letter standing **three places further down the alphabet**.

---

- Handling brute-force cryptanalysis

  - Employs of a **large number of keys** to makes brute-force cryptanalysis impractical
  - If the **language** of the plaintext is **unknown**, then plaintext output may **not be recognizable**.
  - the input may be **abbreviated** or **compressed** in some fashion, again making recognition difficult.

---

#### Monoalphabetic Cipher

- `Monoalphabetic Cipher`

  - a substitution technique in which **a single cipher alphabet** is used **per message**

- Attack
  - are easy to break because they reflect the **frequency** data of the original alphabet.
  - If the cryptanalyst knows the **nature** of the plaintext (e.g., noncompressed English text), then the analyst can exploit the **regularities** of the language.
    - `digrams`
      - the frequency of two-letter combinations
  - 2 approaches to improve:
    - One approach is to **encrypt multiple letters** of plaintext,
    - and the other is to use **multiple** cipher **alphabets**..

---

#### Playfair Cipher

- `Playfair Cipher`

  - treats **digrams** in the plaintext **as single units** and translates these units into ciphertext Digrams.
  - use of a **5 \* 5 matrix** of letters constructed using a keyword.

- a great advance over simple monoalphabetic ciphers.

  - 676 digrams, so that identification of individual digrams is more difficult.
  - relative **frequencies of individual letters** exhibit a much **greater** range than that of **digrams**, making frequency analysis much more difficult.

- cons
  - leaves much of the **structure** of the plaintext **language** intact

---

#### Hill Cipher

- Strength is that it **completely hides single-letter frequencies**

  - The use of a **larger matrix** hides more frequency information
  - A 3 x 3 Hill cipher hides not only single-letter but also two-letter frequency information

- Strong against a **ciphertext-only attack** but easily broken with a known **plaintext attack**

---

#### Polyalphabetic Ciphers

- `polyalphabetic substitution cipher`

  - use different **monoalphabetic substitutions** as one proceeds through the plaintext message.

- features:
  - 1.  A set of related **monoalphabetic substitution** rules is used.
  - 2.  A **key** determines which particular rule is chosen for a given **transformation**.

---

##### Vigenère Cipher

- `Vigenère cipher`

  - one of the simplest, **polyalphabetic** ciphers
  - the set of related monoalphabetic substitution rules consists of the **26 Caesar ciphers** with shifts of 0 through 25.
  - Each cipher is denoted by a **key letter**, which is the ciphertext letter that substitutes for the plaintext letter a.
    - Thus, a Caesar cipher with a **shift of 3** is denoted by the **key value 3**.

- The strength of this cipher:
  - there are **multiple** **ciphertext** letters for each **plaintext** letter, one for each unique letter of the keyword.
    - Thus, the letter **frequency** information is **obscured**.
- Con:
  - considerable frequency information remains.

---

#### Vernam Cipher

- The essence of this technique is the **means of construction of the key**.
- Vernam proposed the use of a **running loop of tape** that eventually **repeated** the key, so
  that in fact the system worked with a very long but repeating keyword.
- Although such a scheme, with a long key, presents formidable cryptanalytic **difficulties**, it can be broken with **sufficient ciphertext**, the use of known or probable plaintext sequences, or both.

---

#### One-Time Pad

- Use a **random key** that is as **long as the message** so that the key need not be repeated Key is used to encrypt and decrypt a single message and then is discarded
- Each **new message** requires a **new key** of the **same length as the new message**
- Scheme is **unbreakable**

  - Produces random output that bears **no statistical relationship** to the `plaintext`
  - Because the ciphertext contains no information whatsoever about the plaintext, there is simply **no way to break the code**

- Con
- The `one-time pad` offers **complete security** but, in practice, has two fundamental difficulties:
  - There is the practical problem of making **large quantities of random keys**
    - Any heavily used system might require millions of **random characters** on a regular basis
  - **Mammoth key distribution problem**
    - For every message to be sent, a **key of equal length** is needed by both sender and receiver
- Because of these difficulties, the one-time pad is of **limited utility**
- Useful primarily for **low-bandwidth channels** requiring very **high security**
- The one-time pad is the only cryptosystem that exhibits **perfect secrecy** (see Appendix F)

---

### Transposition Technique

#### Rail Fence Cipher

- **Simplest** transposition cipher
- Plaintext is written down as a **sequence of diagonals** and then read off as a sequence of rows

---

#### Row Transposition Cipher

- Is a more complex transposition
- **Write** the message in a **rectangle**, **row by row**,
- **and** read the message off, **column by column**, but permute the order of the columns

---

### Steganography 隐写术

- not encryption,

- A plaintext message may be **hidden** in one of two ways:

  - `steganography`: **conceal the existence** of the message,
  - whereas the methods of cryptography render the message **unintelligible** to outsiders by various transformations of the text.

- A simple form of `steganography`, but one that is **time-consuming** to construct, is one in which an arrangement of words or letters within an apparently innocuous text spells out the real message.

- Steganography vs. Encryption
  - `Steganography` has a number of **drawbacks** when compared to encryption
    - It requires a lot of **overhead** to hide a relatively few bits of information
    - Once the system is discovered, it becomes virtually worthless
  - The **advantage** of steganography
    - It can be **employed by parties** who have something to lose should the fact of their secret communication (not necessarily the content) be discovered
    - Encryption flags **traffic** as important or secret or may identify the sender or receiver as someone **with something to hide**

---

- Other Steganography Techniques
  - **Character marking**
    - **Selected letters** of printed or typewritten text are **over-written** in pencil
    - The **marks** are ordinarily **not visible** unless the paper is held at an angle to bright light
  - **Invisible ink**
    - A number of substances can be used for writing but leave no visible trace until heat or some **chemical** is applied to the paper
  - **Pin punctures**
    - Small pin **punctures** on selected letters are ordinarily not visible unless the paper is held up in front of a light
  - **Typewriter correction ribbon**
    - Used **between lines typed** with a black ribbon, the results of typing with the correction tape are visible only under a strong light

## Block Ciphers

- `stream cipher`
  - one that **encrypts a digital data stream** one bit or one byte **at a time**.
  - e.g.: **autokeyed Vigenère cipher** and the **Vernam cipher**.
- In the ideal case, a **one-time pad** version of the **Vernam cipher** would be used, in which the **keystream** (ki) is as long as the **plaintext bit stream** (pi ).

  - If the cryptographic keystream is **random**, then this cipher is **unbreakable** by any means other than acquiring the keystream.
  - However, the keystream must be provided to both users in advance via some independent and secure channel.
  - This introduces insurmountable logistical problems if the intended **data traffic** is very **large**.

- Accordingly, for practical reasons, the bit-stream generator must be implemented as an **algorithmic procedure**, so that the cryptographic bit stream can be produced by both users.
  - In this approach (Figure 4.1a), the bit-stream generator is a key-controlled algorithm and must produce a bit stream that is cryptographically strong.
  - That is, it must be computationally impractical to predict future portions of the bit stream based on previous portions of the bit stream.
  - The two users **need only share the generating key**, and each can produce the keystream.

---

## Block Cipher

- `block cipher`

  - one in which a **block of plaintext** is treated as a whole and used to **produce a ciphertext block of equal length**.
  - Typically, a block size of `64` or `128` bits is used.
  - the two users **share a symmetric encryption key** (Figure 4.1b).
  - a **block** cipher can be used to achieve the **same** effect as a **stream cipher**.

- Far **more effort has** gone into **analyzing** block ciphers.
- In general, they seem applicable to a broader **range of applications** than stream ciphers.
  - The vast majority of network-based symmetric cryptographic **applications** make use of block ciphers.

---

### Feistel Cipher

- `Feistel Cipher`

  - the execution of **two or more simple ciphers in sequence** in such a way that the final result or product is cryptographically stronger than any of the component ciphers.
  - to develop a block cipher with a key length of k bits and a block length of n bits, allowing a total of `2k` possible transformations, rather than the `2n !` transformations available with the ideal block cipher.
  - `Substitution`:

    - **Each** plaintext element or group of elements is **uniquely replaced** by a **corresponding** ciphertext element or group of elements.

  - `Permutation`:
    - A sequence of plaintext elements is **replaced by a permutation** of that sequence.
      - That is, no elements are added or deleted or replaced in the sequence, rather the **order** in which the elements appear in the sequence is **changed**.

- Is a practical application of a proposal by Claude Shannon to develop a product cipher that **alternates confusion and diffusion functions**
- Is the **structure** used by many significant **symmetric block ciphers** currently in use

---

#### Diffusion and Confusion

- `Diffusion`
  - The **statistical structure** of the plaintext is dissipated into **long-range statistics** of the ciphertext
  - This is achieved by having each plaintext digit affect the value of many ciphertext digits
- `Confusion`
  - Seeks to make the **relationship** between the **statistics of the ciphertext** and the value of the encryption **key** as complex as possible
  - Even if the attacker can get some handle on the statistics of the ciphertext, the way in which the key was used to produce that ciphertext is so complex as to make it **difficult to deduce the key**

---

#### Feistel Cipher Design Features

- `Block size`
  - **Larger** block sizes mean **greater** security but **reduced** encryption/decryption **speed** for a given algorithm
- `Key size`
  - **Larger** key size means greater **security** but may **decrease** encryption/decryption **speeds**
- `Number of rounds`
  - The essence of the Feistel cipher is that a single round offers inadequate security but that **multiple** rounds offer increasing **security**
- `Subkey generation algorithm`
  - **Greater** complexity in this algorithm should lead to greater **difficulty** of cryptanalysis
- **Round function F**
  - **Greater** complexity generally means **greater resistance** to cryptanalysis
- **Fast software encryption/decryption**
  - In many cases, encrypting is embedded in applications or utility functions in such a way as to preclude a hardware implementation; accordingly, the speed of execution of the algorithm becomes a concern
- **Ease of analysis**
  - If the algorithm can be concisely and clearly explained, it is easier to analyze that algorithm for cryptanalytic vulnerabilities and therefore develop a higher level of assurance as to its strength

---

## Data Encryption Standard (DES)

- Issued in 1977 by the `National Bureau of Standards` (now `NIST`) as Federal Information Processing Standard 46
- Was the **most widely used encryption scheme** until the introduction of the `Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)` in 2001
- **Algorithm** itself is referred to as the `Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)`
- Data are encrypted in `64`-bit **blocks** using a `56`-bit **key**
- The algorithm **transforms** 64-bit **input** in a series of steps into a 64-bit **output**
- The **same** steps, with the **same** key, are used to **reverse** the encryption

---

### Strength of DES

- Timing attacks
  - One in which information about the key or the plaintext is obtained by observing **how long it takes** a given implementation to perform decryptions on various ciphertexts
  - Exploits the fact that an encryption or decryption algorithm often takes slightly different amounts of time on different inputs
  - So far it appears unlikely that this technique will ever be successful against DES or more powerful symmetric ciphers such as triple DES and AES

---

### Block Cipher Design Principles: Number of Rounds

- The **greater** the number of rounds, the more **difficult** it is to perform cryptanalysis
- In general, the criterion should be that the number of **rounds is chosen** so that known cryptanalytic efforts **require greater effort** than a simple brute-force key search attack
- If DES had **`15`** or fewer rounds, differential cryptanalysis would require less effort than a brute-force key search

---

### Block Cipher Design Principles: Design of Function F

- The heart of a `Feistel block cipher` is the **function F**
- The more **nonlinear** F, the more **difficult** any type of cryptanalysis will be
- The SAC and BIC criteria appear to strengthen the effectiveness of the confusion function

---

### Block Cipher Design Principles: Key Schedule Algorithm

- With any Feistel block cipher, the `key` is used to generate one `subkey` for each round
- In general, we would like to select `subkeys` to maximize the difficulty of deducing individual subkeys and the difficulty of working back to the main key
- It is suggested that, at a minimum, the **key schedule** should guarantee key/ciphertext `Strict Avalanche Criterion` and `Bit Independence Criterion`
