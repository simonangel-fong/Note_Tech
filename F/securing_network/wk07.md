## Key Distribution Technique

- Term that refers to the **means of delivering a key to two parties** who wish to exchange data without allowing others to see the key
- For symmetric encryption to work, the two parties to an exchange **must share the same key**, and that key must be protected from access by others
- Frequent key changes are desirable to limit the amount of data compromised if an attacker learns the key

---

## Symmetric key distribution using symmetric encryption

- Given parties A and B, key distribution can be achieved in a number of ways:

  - A can select a key and **physically deliver** it to B
  - A **third party** can select the key and **physically deliver** it to A and B
  - If A and B have **previously and recently** used a key, one party can transmit the new key to the other, encrypted **using the old key**
  - If A and B each has an **encrypted connection to a third party** C, C can deliver a key on the encrypted links to A and B

### Key Distribution Scenario

- 1. A issues a request to `key distribution center (KDC)` for a session key
- 2. KDC responds with a one time session key to the message and is the only one that can read the message
- 3. A stores the session key for use and forwards to B (securely delivered)
- 4. B sends a nonce to A
- 5. A responds to B

### Hierarchical Key Control

- For communication among entities within the **same local domain**, the `local KDC` is responsible for key distribution
  - If two entities in different domains desire a shared key, then the corresponding `local KDC`’s can communicate through a `global KDC`
- The hierarchical concept can be extended to three or more layers
- Scheme minimizes the effort involved in master key distribution because most master keys are those shared by a `local KDC` with its local entities
  - Limits the range of a faulty or subverted KDC to its local area only

---

### Session Key Lifetime

- A `security manager` must **balance** competing considerations:
  - The **more** frequently session keys are **exchanged**, the **more secure** they are
  - The distribution of session keys **delays** the start of any exchange and **places a burden on network capacity**
- For **connection-oriented protocols** one choice is to use the **same session key** for the length of time that the connection is open, using a new session key for each new session
- For a **connectionless protocol** there is no explicit connection initiation or termination, thus it is **not obvious how often** one needs to change the session key

---

- A session key may be established with the following sequence of steps
  - 1. A issues a **request** to B for a session key and includes a **nonce**, N1.
  - 2. B responds with a message that is encrypted using the **shared master key**. The
       response includes the session key selected by B, an identifier of B, the value
       f(N1), and **another nonce**, N2.
  - 3. Using the new session key, A returns f(N2) to B.

---

### Controlling Key Usage

- The concept of a `key hierarchy` and the use of automated key distribution techniques greatly **reduce the number of keys** that must be manually managed and **distributed**
- It also may be desirable to impose some control on the way in which automatically distributed keys are used
- For example, in addition to separating master keys from session keys, we may **wish to define different types of session keys** on the basis of use

---

## Symmetric key distribution using asymmetric encryption

### Simple secret key distribution

### Secret key distribution with confidentiality and authentication

### Key Controls

- Associate a **tag** with each key

  - For use with `DES` and makes use of the extra **8 bits** in each 64-bit DES key
  - The eight non-key bits ordinarily reserved for parity checking form the key tag
  - Because the **tag is embedded in the key**, it is encrypted along with the key when that key is distributed, thus providing protection

- Drawbacks:
  - The **tag length is limited** to 8 bits, limiting its **flexibility** and **functionality**
  - Because the tag is not transmitted in clear form, it can be **used only at the point of decryption**, limiting the ways in which key use can be controlled

---

### A Hybrid Scheme

- In use on IBM mainframes
- Retains the use of a `key distribution center (KDC)` that shares a secret master key with each user and distributes secret session keys encrypted with the master key
- A `public-key scheme` is used to distribute the master keys

- Rationale:
  - Performance
  - Backward compatibility

---

## Distribution of Public Keys

- Several techniques have been proposed for the distribution of public keys. Virtually all these proposals can be grouped into the following general schemes:
  - Public **announcement**
  - Publicly available **directory**
  - Public-key **authority**
  - Public-key **certificates**

---

### X.509 Certificates

- Part of the X.500 series of recommendations that define a **directory service**
- The directory is, in effect, a server or distributed set of servers that **maintains a database of information about users**
- X.509 defines a framework for the provision of authentication services by the X.500 directory to its users
- Was initially issued in 1988 with the latest revision in 2012
- Based on the use of **public-key cryptography and digital signatures**
- Does not dictate the use of a specific algorithm but **recommends** `RSA`
- Does **not** dictate a specific **hash algorithm**
- Each certificate contains the public key of a user and is signed with the private key of a trusted certification authority
- X.509 defines **alternative authentication protocols** based on the use of public-key certificates

---

### Certificates

- `Certificates`
  - Created by a trusted `Certification Authority (CA)` and have the following elements:
    Version
    Serial number
    Signature algorithm identifier
    Issuer name
    Period of validity
    Subject name
    Subject’s public-key information
    Issuer unique identifier
    Subject unique identifier
    Extensions
    Signature

---

### Obtaining a Certificate

- `User certificates` generated by a `CA` have the following **characteristics**:

  - **Any** user with **access to** the `public key` of the CA **can verify** the user public key that was certified
  - No party other than the `certification authority` **can modify the certificate** without this being detected

- Because certificates are unforgeable, they can be placed in a directory without the need for the directory to make special efforts to protect them
- In addition, a user **can transmit** his or her **certificate** directly to other users
- Once B is in possession of A’s certificate, B has confidence that messages it encrypts with A’s public key will be secure from eavesdropping and that messages signed with A’s private key are unforgeable

---

### Certificate Revocation

- Each certificate **includes a period of validity**
- Typically a new certificate is issued just before the expiration of the old one
- It may be desirable on occasion to revoke a certificate before it expires, for one of the following reasons:
  - The user’s `private key` is assumed to be **compromised**
  - The user is **no longer certified** by this CA
  - The CA’s certificate is assumed to be **compromised**
- Each CA must maintain a list consisting of all **revoked but not expired** certificates issued by that CA
- These lists should be posted on the directory

---

### X.509 Version 3

- Version 2 format does not convey all of the information that recent design and implementation experience has shown to be needed
- Rather than continue to add fields to a fixed format, standards developers felt that a more flexible approach was needed
- Version 3 includes a number of **optional extensions**
- The certificate extensions fall into **three main categories**:
  - **Key and policy** information
  - **Subject and issuer** attributes
  - Certification **path constraints**

---

#### Key and Policy Information

- These extensions **convey** additional information about the **subject and issuer keys** plus indicators of **certificate policy**
- A `certificate policy` is a named **set of rules** that indicates the **applicability of a certificate** to a particular community and/or class of application with common security requirements
- Included are:
  Authority key identifier
  Subject key identifier
  Key usage
  Private-key usage period
  Certificate policies
  Policy mappings

---

#### Certificate Subject and Issuer Attributes

- These extensions support **alternative names**, in alternative formats, for a `certificate subject` or `certificate issuer`
- Can **convey** additional information about the **certificate subject** to increase a certificate user’s **confidence** that the certificate subject is a particular person or entity
- The extension fields in this area include:
  - Subject alternative name
  - Issuer alternative name
  - Subject directory attributes

---

#### Certification Path Constraints

- These extensions **allow constraint specifications** to be included in certificates issued for CAs by other CAs
- The constraints may **restrict the types of certificates** that can be issued by the subject CA or that may occur subsequently in a certification chain
- The extension fields in this area include:
  - **Basic** constraints
  - **Name** constraints
  - **Policy** constraints

---

### PKIX Management Functions

- PKIX identifies a number of management **functions** that potentially need to be supported by management protocols:
  Registration
  Initialization
  Certification
  Key pair recovery
  Key pair update
  Revocation request
  Cross certification
