## Web App Firewalls

- `Web Application Firewalls (WAF)` can be used to **thwart attack**s against Web Apps
- These work differently than `Intrusion Prevention Systems` and regular network `firewalls` in the sense that they **focus** on common attacks such as `Cross-site Scripting`, `Injection`, etc.
- Normally based on the `OWASP` list of known attacks

- typically operate on **layers 5-7**
- Can be user/session/app aware
- Extra Protocol support:
  - HTTPS, HTTPS
  - SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
  - DNS
  - FTP
- Examples of commercial Web application Firewalls:
  - Barracuda Networks
  - CloudFlare
  - Pulse Secure
  - Signal Sciences
  - F5 Networks
- may be in place for the site you are **testing**
  - `wafw00f` is the command to use in `Kali` Linux to **test** if one is in place
- Examples:
  - `wafw00f transpirenetworks.com`
  - `wafw00f fanshawec.ca`

---

### Web App Load Balancing

- `Load Balancing Detector (lbd)` can be used to **check if** `DNS` or `HTTP` load balancing is being used by a web server
- The purpose of `load balancers` is to accept incoming traffic and **distribute it across numerous servers** to prevent one server **from being overloaded and denying** service to clients

---

### Proxy Servers

- `Proxy servers` / `forward proxy`

  - deals with **client** traffic
  - a system that acts as an intermediary between a **user** and the **internet**, routing requests through the proxy server to the destination.

- `Reverse Proxy`
  - shields **servers**
  - **analyze** incoming traffic and **distribute** it to the appropriate internal web server
  - Clients will only see the **one** `public IP` address but may be retrieving requested resources from multiple web servers
  - These can be used in **combination** with `WAFs` to enhance Web App security
  - Can also provide:
    - A/B Testing
    - Load Balancing
    - TLS Encryption
    - Content caching
  - Can provide `TLS termination` (SSL termination)
- Takes incoming TLS traffic and **decrypts it before** sending it **forward** on the internal network
- Assumes that the `LAN` is secure

---

## Penetration Testing

### Black-Box vs. White-Box Testing

- `Black-Box testing`
  - done from the outside **with no prior knowledge** of the technologies used by the web application
- It can be **more effective** than White-Box testing because **automated tools** can quickly execute numerous tests

- `White-Box testing`
  - allows the **review of the source code** for an application by a tester
- **Certain** vulnerabilities can be found faster using the code review method

---

- Ideally a web app pen test would include **both** methods
  - **Strange behaviour** in a running application can be looked at in the **source code**
  - **Automated** testing can test the application much faster than manual code review
- Look for a balance between the two methods

---

## Cloud Providers

### ASPs

- `ASPs`
- Organizations today host web services using external providers ranging from simple hosting, to full fledged `Application Service Providers (ASPs)`
- Cloud providers will support multiple customer applications on the same infrastructure
- Often victims of defacing when a single shared host is compromised

- `Shared Hosting`

  - With the introduction of the HOST header in HTTP version 1.1, **a web server** can be configured to host **more than one web application**
  - Multiple domains can resolve to one public IP

- **Customers** who use external providers for web applications will need to **interact with the service**
  - **Upload** capabilities such as FTP or SCP
  - Direct access to ASP infrastructure
    - **VPN**
    - **Database** Setup
    - **SSH**

---

### Hosting Control Panels

- There are a number of hosting panels available on the market with `Cpanel` and `Plesk` being the most popular
- Others include:
  - `DirectAdmin`
  - `Spanel`
  - `Webmin`
  - `Froxlor`

---

### Security Concerns with ASPs

- Any **direct access** to the service providers infrastructure needs to be secured
  - `FTP` may be sent in **plain text**
  - Database connections using `ODBC` can be **unencrypted**
  - Remote access between customers may **not** be properly **segregated**

---

- **Backdoor Scripts**
  - Not all customers are created equal
    - Deliberate backdoors
    - Shell scripts
  - What security level are these shells running in?

---

- **Malicious users**
  - A **PHP script** implanted by a customer on a **shared web server** could allow access to shell commands through a browser
    - These may run as a privileged user (`www-data`)
  - A vulnerable application could allow the compromise of shared applications through:
    - **SQL injection** flaws
    - **Path traversal** vulnerabilities
    - **Command injection** flaws

---

### Securing Shared Access

- Secure customer access
  - **Encrypt** all remote access
  - Grant privileges on a **least-privilege** basis
- **Segregate** customer **functionality**
  - Read/Write **access** to file paths
  - **Reduced access** to system functions
- Segregate **components**
  - Stored procedures, etc.
  - Database servers

---

## Web App Pen Test Tools

- `Web Crawlers`
  - These can be used to **find login portals**, configuration files, backup or OLD copies of pages, administrative notes, etc.
- Examples of Crawlers:
  - `Dirbuster`
  - `Vega`
  - `OWASP-ZAP`
  - `Burp Suite`
  - `Webscarab`
  - `Webslayer`
