## Sessions

- A `session` refers to all the traffic between a web browser and a web server **from the time the user first browses** to the web application to the **time the user is logged out**

  - Also known as a "Single Sitting"

- HTTP is a stateless protocol

  - **No** reason to **store user data** between requests
    - Fine for static pages
  - To manage sessions the web server application **creates an id number to track the HTTP packets** related to a particular user
    - `Session ID`

- `Sessions` allow the user to login while interacting with a web application
  - The internet would be entirely impractical without sessions
  - Especially with interactive web applications
- Session Management areas:
  - **Identifying** and keeping track of the **user**
  - Controlling what the user is **authorized** to do
  - Keeping **track** of what the user has **done**

---

### Session Tracking

- Common methods used to track sessions:
  - Cookies
  - URL
  - Hidden Forms
  - IP Address
  - Web Storage
  - LSOs and Isolated Storage
- Session tracking with cookies is the most used client-side method

---

#### URL

- URL

  - The session ID is written in the browsers address bar
  - The session ID is passed as a parameter in the http get request for all subsequent queries to the web

- Problems with URL parameters
  - User / Attacker has **access** to, and can **modify**, the values
  - There is no defined length limit for a URL, in the HTTP protocol, but many browsers, web applications and servers impose **limits**
    - Reduces the amount of state information that can be maintained

---

#### Hidden Forms

- `Session ID` is written into hidden form elements
- Hidden elements are **not displayed** by the browser
- Can be viewed in HTML page source, but are not normally displayed to the user
  `<input type="hidden" name="Session" value="12345">`

  - Type is hidden
  - Name is Session
  - Value is 12345

- As discussed previously, the input type hidden is not normally visible to the end user through a browser window

---

#### IP Address

- Tracking a user based on IP address
- All users behind a `NAT address` would appear as the same user

---

#### Web Storage

- Sometimes called `HTML5 Local Storage`
- Provides persistent client-side storage
- Attempt to improve on cookies, but the information is still stored client-side
- Information doesn’t need to be sent with each request

---

#### Local Shared Objects (LSOs)

- Used by Adobe Flash
- Sometimes referred to as `Flash Cookies`

---

#### Isolated Storage

- Used by `Silverlight`
- Can provide either client-side or server-side storage

---

#### Cookies

- Most widely used method for tracking session IDs
- Small **plain text files** stored on the user’s computer
- Contains **no executable** code
- limitation (300 cookies, 4096 bytes per cookie, etc.)

---

### HTTP Session

- `HTTP Session` is a series of HTTP **transactions** between a client and a server.
- Cookies are typically used to identify sessions.

---

## Cookies

- `HTTP cookie` is a small file that is

  - Provided by the **server** as an HTTP **response header**
  - Stored by the **client**
  - **Returned** to the server as an HTTP request header

- **Temporary / Per-Session cookies**
  - Stored in memory
  - **Expire** when client **closes** browser
- **Permanent / Persistent cookies**
  - Written to **disk**
  - Store long term user preferences
  - Expire when they reach their **expiration date**
- **Secure**
  - Has the secure attribute and is only used via `HTTPS`
  - Ensures cookie is **encrypted** in transit

---

- **HttpOnly Cookie Flag**
  - **Restricts** session cookie **access** to HTTP or HTTPS
  - No access from non-HTTP APIs (scripting languages)
  - Helps to mitigate the threat of session cookie theft via cross site scripting
- **Third Party Cookie**
  - Set with a different domain than the domain or subdomain shown in the address bar
  - Often used by **advertising sites** to track users across many sites

---

- **Supercookie**
  - In older browsers you could set a cookie that applied to a `top level domain (TLD)`
  - `.com .ca .us`
  - This would allow you to set a cookie that would apply to the entire TLD and its subdomains
- **Zombie Cookie**
  - Refers to cookies that are **regenerated** despite being deleted by the user
  - Flash cookies are known to use this technique
  - Script is used to pull cookie content from storage

---

- Primary Uses of Cookies
  - Session Management
    - Shopping cart contents
    - Authentication status
  - Personalization
    - User preferences
    - User specific content
  - Tracking
    - What pages a user has visited
    - What sequence they visited pages in
    - How long they viewed each page

---

### Session IDs

- The primary security concern when dealing with `session IDs` is that the ID might be stolen
  - Allowing the attacker to **impersonate a user** and **act on their behalf**
- Poorly protected session IDs can be altered by the hacker and resubmitted by the browser
  - Hackers can use a proxy or cookie editor
- In addition to protecting your Session IDs, they shouldn’t be easy to predict

  - They need to have good **entropy**
  - **Long** enough and with **different** characters

- Characteristics of good Session IDs:
  - Truly **random**
  - Have **large** enough range for user base
  - Numbers should **not** be **repeated**
    - Otherwise high traffic situations could result in session ID repetition (Session conflict)
- Remember: if a Session ID can be predicted it will be much easier for an attacker to steal a user’s session

- Tools:
  - `Burp Suite` Sequencer or `WebScarab` to analyze the true randomness of a Session ID

---

### Session Management

- To increase usability, once a user has **authenticated** to the web server they should **not** be asked for account and password information again
  - The session ID is used to **identify** the user submitting the request, or data, to the web server throughout the session
  - Session ID management is **transparent** to the user

---

## Session Hijacking

- `Session hijacking` is the process of taking over an established session
- A Session Hijack specifically refers to the moment when an attacker uses a stolen session token in order to impersonate a user/application
- Takes advantage of the fact that there is already an established session between the client and server

  - **Authentication** has already **taken place**

- The Session Hijacking attack compromises the session token by **stealing or predicting a valid session token** to gain unauthorized access to restricted area (Web Server, Databases, etc.)

- The session token could be compromised in different ways. The most common are:
  - Predictable / Easy to crack session token
  - Session **Sniffing**
  - **Man-in-the-middle** attack
  - Man-in-the-browser attack
  - Client-side attacks (XSS, malicious JavaScript codes, Trojans, etc.)

---

### Steps

- Typical Session Hijacking Attack:
- Find a **victim**
  - Network scanner, sniffers, etc.
- Get **inline**, or between the victim and server
  - Session Sniffing
  - Man-in-the-Middle
  - Man-in-the-Browser
- **Monitor** the traffic between the victim and server

  - Used to determine the protocol being used, or web application being accessed
  - Must be susceptible to session hijacking

- Goal
  - When an attacker hijacks the session, they can **present** themselves to the server **as if they are the victim**
  - The attacker will often use a DoS attack against the victim when they steal the session

---

### Session Hijacking Levels

- **Network Level** Hijacking
  - Involves the interception of packets between the victim and server
    - ARP poisoning
    - DNS Spoofing
    - Guessing the next sequence number in the TCP/IP conversation
  - In most cases attacker must be **on the same network** as the victim
- **Application-Level Hijacking**
  - Involves gaining control of the HTTP session by obtaining the session ID
    - **Guessing / Brute forcing** session IDs
    - **Sniffing unencrypted** traffic for session IDs
    - Using HTML injection or Cross Site Scripting to get the victim to divulge the session data
    - Compromising the victim machine and pulling the Session ID off the computer

---

### Session Hijacking Types

- **Active**
  - The attacker finds a session between the victim and server and takes it over
- **Passive**
  - The attacker gets between the victim and server, but simply **records the traffic** for later use
- An active hijacking attack usually begins with a passive hijacking attack

---

### Session Prediction / Cracking Attack

- This attack focuses on predicting / cracking / brute forcing session ID values.
- An attacker can **bypass the authentication schema** of an application.

---

### Session Sniffing Attack

- The attacker uses a sniffer to **capture a valid session token** (session-id), then he/she uses the valid token session to gain unauthorized access to the Web Server.

---

### Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM)

- The man-in-the middle attack **intercepts a communication** between two **systems**

- Involves the attacker placing themselves between the victim and server
- Data can be **intercepted**, **modified** and retransmitted between the source and destination

---

### Man-in-the-Browser Attack (MITB)

- Same approach as MITM, but relies on malware / Trojan horses to intercept and manipulate calls **between the browser and the browser’s** security mechanism, sniffing or modifying transactions as they are formed on the browser, but still displaying back the user's intended transaction

---

### Cross-Site Scripting Session Attack

- The attacker can compromise the session token by using malicious code or programs running at the client-side.
  - It's possible to create specific JavaScript code that will send the cookie info to the attacker

---

### MITM and MITB Uses

- Take over the session (session hijacking)
  - User might know (if DoS is used), but server won't
- Gather information for later use
  - If poor session expiration management is used
- Gathering information for concurrent use
  - If concurrent sessions are allowed
- Simply Gather Information
  - Steal the user's logon credentials
  - Steal other information about the client

---

### Session Hijacking vs. Session Spoofing

- Session Spoofing is like Session Hijacking except that the attacker **doesn't actively take the victim offline**
  - With `Session Hijacking` the **victim, attacker and server** **all** need to be **online at the same time**
    - The attacker needs the victim to be online so they can take over the session
  - With `session spoofing` only the **attacker and server** need to be online at the same time
    - The attacker pretends to be victim while the victim is offline

---

### Session Hijacking vs. Session Replay

- Both are forms of Man-in-the-Middle attacks
  - With `session replay` the attacker captures packets then sends them to the server **at a later time**
  - An attacker could capture a valid user’s authentication process
  - After the session is over, the attacker could replay the captured authentication process to **initiate another session**

---

### Session Sidejacking

- Takes advantage of sites that use **SSL encryption (HTTPS)** for login pages, but **revert to unencrypted HTTP** after authentication
  - Attacker can't see the initial authentication, but can see everything else sent between the client and server
  - The attacker can now steal the cookie being passed between the server and client, as this often isn't part of the authentication process and is done over HTTP

---

### Session Fixation

- Takes advantage of web applications that initially use **anonymous sessions** / tokens
  - Attacker needs to get token and pass it to the victim
  - After authentication the same session is upgraded to an authenticated session
- In these attacks the session ID isn’t changed when the authentication state changes!

---

## Session Security

### Expiration

- `Session ID expiration` is used to define when the session is **over**
- This is a difficult problem as the server only sees page requests from the user
  - Doesn’t necessarily see when the user closes the web page
- Expiration ensures that, if a cookie is acquired by a hacker it will be of limited use/value

  - Duration of client session
  - Accessing limited information

- There are a number of ways expiration can be handled:

  - Browser Close
  - Fixed Time After Login
  - Fixed Time After New Request
  - Never
  - Authentication on Action

---

- **Browser Close**

  - The session stays open until the user closes the browser
  - Even if they immediately open the browser again they will be required to log in

- **Fixed Time After Login (Absolute Timeout)**

  - A session duration is set (e.g. 1 hour)
  - If the user logs in at 11am, then closes their browser, opens it, and navigates to the site again before 12pm, they will still be logged in
  - If they waited until after 12pm then would be required to log in again

- **Fixed Time After New Request (Idle Timeout)**

  - As with fixed time after login, you set a **duration** for which the **session is valid**
  - Unlike fixed time after login, every time the user makes a new page request the timer is reset
  - A benefit of this method is that you can reduce the expiration time
  - **Reducing the period of time** a stolen session ID is useful for
  - A downside to this method is that many AJAX applications continually poll the server
  - Basically become Browser Close method

- **Never**

  - Once a user is logged on they could close the browser and open it three years later and still be logged on
  - Only used when security is not a concern

- **Authentication on Action**
  - Regardless of when a user logged on, if they are going to perform a **high risk action**, they will need to **authenticate again**
  - Need to pay special attention to your definitions regarding high risk actions

---

- Session ID Expiration Methods can be combined
  - Fixed Time After Login
  - Browser Close
- You get the benefits of both
- Session ID Expiration attempts to reduce the likelihood of a stolen session ID being useful to an attacker

---

### Cookie Security

- Limit third party cookies
- Set browser to delete temporary internet files when the browser closes
- Take the time to look at what cookies are being set on your machines
- All the major browsers allow you to do this

---

### Session ID Defense

- Use **Cryptographically** Random `Session IDs`
  - Prevents guessing of session IDs
- **Destroy Invalidated** Session IDs
  - Once the session ID has expired get rid of it
- Use **Encrypted** Cookies
  - If you need to store state information on the client encrypt it
- Logging Out

  - The best way to confirm that a session is over is to have the user log out
  - Make it easy

- **Educating** the users
  - Paying attention to https vs. non-https, properly signing out, not clicking on links
- Using **high entropy** in session token generation
  - Higher the entropy more difficult to predict
- Timing out and/or re-generating sessions
  - reduce window of vulnerability
- Using **SSL** for all communications
  - difficult to sniff
- Forcing **Re-authentication** or step-up authentication
  - limit damage if session is hijacked
- **Encrypting** session and cookies data
  - prevents session spoofing
- Using **Context data** for validating session-ids / Secondary checks for Sessions
  - make it difficult to use a hijacked id
- Input **validation**
  - prevent XSS and other vulnerabilities

---

### Session Hijacking Prevention

- Protection from **Sidejacking**

  - Using **SSL** for all communications
    - Client can use tools such as HTTPS-Everywhere, force the sites to use HTTPS protocol, etc.
    - Make sure you are only connecting to WPA2 encrypted Access points
    - Use VPN connection
  - **Encrypting** session and cookies data

- Protection from Session **Fixation**
  - Forcing **Re-authentication** or step-up authentication
    - Issue a new token when the state goes from unauthenticated to authenticated or from unidentified to identified.
  - Using **Context data** for validating session-ids / Secondary checks for Sessions
  - Use per-page tokens in addition to the main session token

---

### MITM Tools

- MITM Attack Tools

  - PacketCreator
  - Ettercap
  - Dsniff
  - Cain & Abel

- MITM Proxy-only Tools
  - OWASP WebScarab
  - Paros Proxy
  - Burp Proxy
  - ProxyFuzz
  - Odysseus Proxy
  - Fiddler (by Microsoft)

---

## Authentication Management

- `Authentication` is how web applications determine who gets what access to data
- It is the front line defense against malicious users
- In theory, it is simple, but in reality it can cause problems
- If a malicious user can bypass authentication systems, they can potentially obtain unrestricted access to the application and data stored within it

- There are numerous authentication methods available:
  - **HTML** authentication
  - **SSL** certificates
  - **Multifactor** authentication systems with passwords and tokens
  - **Integrated** authentication using NTLM or Kerberos
- Most web applications use HTML to retrieve a username and password

- attacks can focus on the client side
  - Phishing
  - Client side Trojans
- Intranet users typically have integrated systems in place where a user provides their domain credentials to get access to network resources

- Password requirements are often insufficient to provide security
  - Most web applications do not require lengthy passwords and users are often careless with their passwords
  - The longer the password, the more difficult it will be to brute force

---

## Testing Authentication

- Obtain a list of valid username

- If you have a valid account, test to see if the application has a lock out policy
- If it does and you are locked out, test to see if the application reacts differently when proper credentials are supplied than when incorrect credentials are used during the lockout

- Most applications have a username and password combination
  - If the application specifies which of the two was incorrect during a login attempt, it narrows down the attack exponentially
- Test for valid usernames either through the login page or by using other functions such as:

  - User registration (Username exists!)
  - Forgot Password

- If attempting to brute force email accounts, tools can be used to obtain valid email addresses that can serve as the username
- A lot of organizations use the staff member’s email address as the username
- Burp Suite’s Comparer tool can be used to check if there are any subtle differences in the response from a server if a valid or invalid username has been used

- Password change functions in web applications can offer different security practices than login pages:

  - May provide more verbose responses when a username is incorrect
  - Lock lock out rules when entering the existing password
  - Offer insight on the existing password when entering a new password and confirming it

- Password recovery functions may contain secondary challenges such as:
  - If an application sends a password recovery link to a specified email address, it could be found in a hidden field or a cookie

pass

---

## Securing Authentication

- The key to securing authentication lays in the balance between **security** and **usability**
- Things to consider:

  - Cost of security and support
  - The level of security users are willing to deal with
  - The risk involved with the functionality of the app
  - The value of the data

- **Credential Security**

  - Long passwords should be used
  - Set minimum lengths / Complexity
  - Enforce unique usernames
  - Utilize high entropy for auto-generated or mass produced password

- **Credential Handling**

  - All client-server communication should be done over **encrypted** channels
  - `POST` requests should be used to transmit credentials
    - Do not use GET
    - URL parameters
    - Cookies
  - Passwords should be stored as salted hashes in the database to prevent recovery
  - Passwords should be changed regularly
  - Passwords should never be the same as usernames
  - Users should be required to change their passwords on initial login

- **Credential Validation**

  - Applications should not truncate passwords
  - **Special characters** need to be considered even with input validation
  - Catch all approaches should force closure of any sessions or login attempts
  - User impersonation should be limited to authorized or elevated users only
  - Multi stage verification should always be stored on the server side
  - Data should not be retransmitted from a client
  - At no point should the application allow the client to know which stage of the authentication process has failed
  - Any challenge questions should be stored server side and not transmitted to the client
  - Challenge questions should not be verified until the entire authentication process has been conclude

- **Information Leakage**

  - A **generic error** message should be used for failed login attempts regardless of why the attempt has failed
  - An attacker should not receive a different result based on what changed in the authentication parameters

  - If users are permitted to create their own username during the registration process, **email should be used as the username**
    - This prevents the attacker from enumerating usernames because a generic message can be displayed
    - “Please check your email to continue registration”

- **Brute-Force**

  - Accounts can be disabled after a number of failed login attempts
    - This can lead to DOS for legitimate users
  - Would be better to implement account **suspension**

    - Lock account out for 30 mins
    - Slows down a brute force attack considerably

  - Accounts that have been suspended should **not divulge any information** regarding the lock out policy in place
    - Use a **generic error** message
  - The application should **not** process login attempts for suspended accounts

    - This could potentially lead to information leakage allowing for brute-force attacks to continue

  - If using technologies such as `CAPTCHA` to enhance the prevention of brute-force attacks, ensure that it is implemented correctly
  - Answers to the puzzle should **not** be available in the **HTML form**
    - Alt attribute of images
    - Hidden input fields

- **Password Change**

  - Users should be allowed to periodically change their passwords
  - This function should **only be allowed for authenticated sessions** and force the user to enter their current valid password

    - The username should not be used as there is no reason why you should need to change another user’s password

  - This function should also have a **limit on how many attempts** a user can have to change their password
  - **Disable** the function if a user has **incorrectly entered** their current password or made mistakes entering the new password

    - Passwords don’t match err

  - Users should be **notified** if their password has been changed through a means outside of the application
  - An email can be generated to the user’s email address but must not contain any information about the new or previous password

- **Password Recovery**

  - Security critical applications such as online banking, should not use automated password recovery functions but **rely on other methods**

    - Telephone
    - Visit a branch
    - Etc.

  - When implementing an automated password recovery function:
    - Do not use password hints
  - Send an email to the address on the account with a link to a URL that is:

    - Unique
    - Time-limited
    - Using high entropy

  - Challenge questions should be set by the application and not by the user
    - Users can create weak challenge questions or make the answer obvious in the question
  - Answers should use high entropy
    - What was the name of the street you grew up on?
    - Not What is your favourite colour?
