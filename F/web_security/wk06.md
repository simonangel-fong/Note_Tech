## PHP Basics

- `PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor`

  - Originally called "Personal Home Pages tools"

- `Server-side scripting language`

  - Runs on a server, not your local machine
  - Removes some of the easier attacks such as using a proxy on a local machine
  - PHP is free (open source)
  - php.net is a great source of information

- Widely-used general-purpose scripting language
  - Has similar syntax to C, but is much simpler
- Primarily used for Web Development

  - Generating **dynamic, interactive** web pages
  - Interacting with database management systems (DBMS)
  - Relational database management systems (RDBMS)
  - Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMS)

- When it comes to web applications PHP is well suited to interacting with the back-end database
  - Validating user input
  - Sanitizing user input
  - Accepting user input
  - Interacting with the contents of the database
  - Adding, modifying, deleting, etc.
- PHP handles connection and communication with databases

- PHP & MySQL

  - MySQL is a relational database management system
    - Like PHP, MySQL is free (GPL license)
    - Lightweight, fast, easy to use RDBMS
  - PHP can also interact with other databases
    - MS SQL Server
    - PostgreSQL
    - LDAP
    - Many More

- HTML and PHP code in a PHP file

  - **HTML** is used for the **static** content
  - **PHP** is used to generate the **dynamic** content

- PHP code returns HTML that is displayed by the web browser

  - The client can’t view the PHP, they only see the HTML returned by the web server

- need a web server running the PHP software (PHP Engine/Module)
  - PHP software runs on all popular web servers
  - We are using a `LAMP` stack on an Ubuntu server
  - `Linux` operating system
  - Includes `Apache`, `MySQL`, and `PHP`

---

### Basic PHP

- `PHP files` use a default extension of `.php`
  - A PHP file will usually contain **HTML** and **PHP** code
- The PHP code can be placed **anywhere** in the file
- PHP scripts start with `<?php` and end with `?>`
- Don’t make the mistake of trying to use `<?php>` or `<?>`
- Everything from the <?php …to the… ?> and the content between is considered a **code block**

- sometimes see php scripts starting with `<?` and ending with `?>`
  - short_open_tag flag
  - Not recommended because XML files use `<?`
- To use the short form tags you would need to enable this in your `php.ini` file
- The `php.ini` file contains your PHP configuration
- `php.ini` can be edited with a text editor

---

- `echo` and `print`

  - don’t need to use parentheses ()
  - can do error checking with `print` as it returns an `int`
    - 1 if it worked
    - 0 if it failed

- e.g.:
  - `echo "Using echo to output a string";`
  - `print "Using print to output a string";`

---

- `printf()`

  - output formatted strings
  - 右括号

- `printf("I got %0.2f on my last test.", 95.4567);`
  - `I got 95.46 on my last test.`

---

- Comments
  - Inline Comments:
    - `//` Use two forward slashes for a single inline comment
  - Block Comments:
    - `/*` Use a forward slash asterisk, then a closing asterisk and a forward slash `*/`
  - Shell Comments
    - `#` Using a hash
    - Strongly discouraged

---

- Variables

  - starts with a dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name:
    - `$x $x2 $MyVar`
    - Must **begin** with a **letter** or an **underscore**
    - Can only contain **alpha-numeric** characters and **underscores**
    - Should **not** contain **spaces**
    - Case sensitive

- e.g.:
  - `$x=5;`
  - `$hello="Hello World!";`
- use quotes (" or ') around your text
- don’t need to declare (define) a data type
- use the concatenation operator (`.`) to join two string values.
  - e.g:

```php
$myname="Art Mack";
$hello='Hello World!';
echo $myname . " using variables to say " . $hello;
```

- 单双引号

```php
$hello='Hello World!';
echo "$hello"; // the output is: Hello World!
echo '$hello'; // the output is: $hello

```

---

- `phpinfo()`
  - Commonly used to **check configuration settings and environmental** variables for a given system

---

### Security Areas

- Validating and Sanitizing User Input
- Preventing SQL Injection
- Preventing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Preventing Remote Execution
- Security for Temporary Files
- Preventing Session Hijacking

---

### Specific Input Risks

- Risk stems from the fact that PHP is a **loosely typed language**
  - No need to declare variables
  - Without proper input validation users can supply data of the wrong type, or size, or containing special characters
- Controls
  - Declare your variables
  - Use Input Validation
  - Check the type, length and format of inputs
  - Sanitize values

---

### Security Basics

- It is important to consider the key principles
  - Ensure you are using the **current version** of PHP
  - Balance Risk and Usability
  - Control User Input with **Input validation**
  - Track Your Data
    - Control how data enters your application, is stored, and how it exits
  - Sanitize the Data (escaping, encoding, etc.)
  - Controlling how data is sent to clients, databases, etc.

---

## Databases

- Databases are used for a variety of purposes
  - Client Information
  - Product and Pricing Information
  - Banking Information
  - Inventory Information
  - Much More
- The database contains the actual data
- The database management system is used to interact with that data

- `Database (DB)`

  - is simply a collection of data.
  - In Relational Database (RDB), data is organized into `tables`.

- Term "Relational" refers to the relationship **between columns** within a table and also to links **between tables**.

- Schema
  - A description of a particular collection of data (**a set of table** designs that determine a database).
  - Does not yet include the data – simply shows how it will be structured in the database

---

- The power of relational databases comes from the tables being related to each other.
- These relationships are **controlled through keys**:
  - **Primary** Key
  - An attribute that **uniquely** identifies an entity in a table.
  - Any table with lots of records should have one.
    - Example: Student ID 10147 identifies student 'Boris'
  - **Foreign** Key
  - Used to provide relationships **between** tables
  - Usually related to the primary key in the related table
    - Example: Student ID 10147 identifies student 'Boris' as a citizen of France

---

- Relationships

  - `One-to-One`
    - **An** entity in a table **corresponds to a single entity** in another table.
    - The relationship is typically established using a foreign key for one or both entities.
      - Example: If we have a table for Student_Info and a table for Academic_History, there is a One-to-One relationship between them.
  - `One-to-Many`

    - **An entity** in a table **corresponds to 1 or more entities** in another table.
      - Example: If the table for Academic_History has an entry for each term, the relationship now becomes one student to many terms.

  - `Many-to-Many`
    - **Multiple entities** in one table **correspond to multiple entities** in another table.
    - Example: Tables Student_Info and Courses_Taken have a many to many relationship, since a student can take many courses and each course can be taken by many students.
    - Many-to-Many relationship is often defined by a `separate table`, which in fact changes it **into two One-to-Many** relationships.

---

- `Database Engine` ("Storage Engine")

  - Is the underlying **software component** for storing, processing and securing data.

- `Transaction` is a sequence of database actions (reads/writes) performed on a database that work as a unit.
  - `ACID` Properties of Database Transactions:
    - `Atomicity` (all-or-nothing property)
      - If only some of the operations were successful, the transaction is not considered complete
    - `Consistency` (rows affected by transaction remain consistent)
    - If the transaction is not completed, the data is not affected
    - `Isolation` (no transaction interference)
    - multiple transactions will not affect each other
    - `Durability` (committed transactions are protected against crashes)
    - Anything in the buffer/memory has been permanently written to the disk
    - If there were to be a power outage for example, the transaction has been completed and the data would not be lost

---

### Vendors

- Commercial
  - Oracle
  - IBM (DB2, Informix)
  - Microsoft SQL
  - Sybase (ASE, IQ)
  - Teradata
- Open Source
  - MySQL (InnoDB and MyISAM storage engines)
  - Percona (optimized version of MySQL)
  - MariaDB, fork of MySQL (XtraDB storage engine, Aria)
  - PostgreSQL
  - SQLite

---

## MySQL

- `MySQL` is a Relational Database Management System.
- SQL stands for the Structured Query Language.
  - It defines how to insert, retrieve, modify and delete data.
- `MySQL` is the most popular open source DBMS: http://www.mysql.com
  - Multiple storage engines (MyISAM, InnoDB, Memory, etc.)
  - Views creation and update
  - Transactions with the InnoDB Engine
  - Sub Queries / Nested Select
  - Primary and Foreign keys and indexing

---

### Storage Engines

- `CSV`
  - The engine stores data in **text files** using comma-separated values format.
- `Memory`
  - The engine creates tables with contents that are stored in memory.
- `MyISAM`
  - Default in 5.1. Non-transaction Engine.
  - No transaction overhead: much faster, lower disk space requirements, less memory required to perform updates.
- `InnoDB`
  - Default in 5.5. Transaction-safe (ACID compliant) Engine.
  - Safe, can combine many statements with one COMMIT, can execute ROLLBACK, row-level locking.

---

### Basic Operations

- Create table
- Insert records
- Retrieve records
- Update records
- Delete records
- Modify table
- Join table
- Drop table
- Count, Like, Order by, Group by, limit
- Optimize table
- Advanced (sub-queries, stored procedures, triggers, views …)

---

### Monitor (Console Access)

- MySQL allows console access:

  - `mysql –h hostname –u username –p [password]`

- MySQL commands are NOT case‐sensitive.
- have to end with a semicolon (`;`).

```sql
SHOW databases;
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
USE database_name;
CREATE table table_name (column definitin, column definition, ….);
SHOW tables;
```

- `phpMyAdmin` is a web interface that allows us to manage MySQL

---

### Database Security Concepts

- Controlling access to the database, tables, etc.
- Controlling access to administrative features
- Creating Tables
- Altering Tables
- Deleting Tables
- Controlling the type of access people have
- Read-only (Select), write-only (Update), etc.
- Access to specific tables / columns
- Restricting the ability to manage user accounts

---

- User management

```sql
CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT all on databasename.* to username@localhost identified by 'password';
GRANT select, insert on databasename.* to username@localhost identified by 'password';
DROP USER 'username';
FLUSH privileges;
SHOW GRANTS for 'username'@'localhost';
```

- Create tb

```sql
CREATE TABLE `students` (
    `studentID` int unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
    `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL default '',
    `major` varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',
    `grade` tinyint NOT NULL default '0',
    PRIMARY KEY (`studentID`)
)
ENGINE=MyISAM
DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

```

---

### Grant Privileges

- By default, even if you grant a user all privileges at the command prompt, they **can’t** themselves **grant** privileges to **others**.
  - You need to specifically give a user this permission
    - `WITH GRANT OPTION`
- Even if a user has the grant permission they can only grant permissions they have themselves
  - They can’t create a more powerful user

---

- Privileges Scope

- Global Privileges
  - `ON *.*`
- Specific Database, all Tables
  - `ON specific_db.*`
- Specific Database, Specific Table
  - `ON specific_db.specific_table`
- Specific Columns
  - `UPDATE (col1,col2) ON specific_db.specific_table`
- Routine
  - Apply to stored routines (functions & procedures)

---

- could also specify a specific IP the connection is allowed from
  - `user@192.168.101.11`

---

### Securing PHPMyAdmin

- We need to make sure `phpMyAdmin` is locked down
  - By **default** there is **no password** for the `root` account
  - Adding a password for the root account is a two step process:
    - Modify the root account in `phpMyAdmin`
    - Add the newly created password to the `config.inc` file inside the `phpMyAdmin` folder

---

### MySQL and Client/Server Model:

- Before you can access a database, a connection to the database must be created.
- The interaction with MySQL server consists of the following steps:
  - **Connect** to MySQL server (requires a username and password).
  - **Select** the active **database** ('use database' analog).
  - Perform SQL queries and retrieve results.
  - Free Results
  - Close connection to MySQL
