## Scripts

- Systems can be **automated** using `scripts`
- `Scripts` are written to be run in a particular environment
- A shell will act as an **interpreter**

  - Linux: Bash, korn, etc.
  - Windows: cmd.exe, batch files, powershell, etc

The `Bourne-Again shell` or `Bash` is a free program that is used by most Linux distributions

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Specifies the bash shell
```

---

- `Bash` scripts can be executed in sequence or conditionally, based on the desired functionality
- Shell scripts can help you **improve the efficiency** of your system administration tasks

  - Backups
  - System updates
  - Scans

- Bash scripts will need to have the **appropriate permissions** to be executed
- **Execute permissions** must be granted to the user invoking the script
- During lab, change the permissions to 755
  - `chmod 755 name_of_script.sh`

  - an open source cross-platform software that can be used with the following Operating Systems:
    - BSD
    - Linux
    - macOS
    - Windows
    - Etc.

- `Clam` development is currently under the `Cisco` umbrella
  - Originally developed by independent developers, it was then purchased by `Sourcefire` and added to their `Vulnerability Research Team`
- `Cisco` acquired Sourcefire and added the Clam VRT team to Cisco Talos

- When installing `ClamAV` on Ubuntu, there are a few **components** to keep in mind:
  - `clamav`
  - `clamav-daemon`
  - `clamav-freshclam`
- `FreshClam` will update the **signature database** for viruses and malware

- It can be used to **detect phishing scams**, as well as **scanning documents** being transmitted by email

  - HTML
  - Rich Text Format (RTF)
  - Portable Document Format (PDF)
  - MS Office documents

- `ClamAV` can be customized to **scan specific directories** in the file system

  - This will scan everything in the `/home` directory: `clamscan –ri /home`

- remove option

  - automatically remove any files that are detected as malicious
  - e.g., `clamscan –ri --remove /home`

- exclude option
  - exclude the `/sys`, `/proc` and `/dev` directories
  - `clamscan –ri --exclude-dir=^/sys\|^/proc\|^/dev/`

## Send Mail

- `Send mail`

  - a free and open source utility that allows your server to **send SMTP messages**

- `Send mail` can be **run in a shell** making it useful for **automating** tasks that require email notifications
- Any task that can be executed from the Shell, can be incorporated into a script
- Scripts can be added to **cron jobs** (The equivalent of a task scheduled in Windows)

- configuration file
  - `/etc/mail/sendmail.mc`

---

## Automation

- This will be complimented with a script that runs on an hourly basis
- Uses ClamAV to scan specified directories
- Logs the results
- Emails alerts based on configuration

---

- `ClamAV` Aggressive set to `1` will attempt to **remove** any files considered to be a threat
  - Aggressive set to `0` will **not remove** any files
