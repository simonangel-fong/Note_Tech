- `IP Addresses`
- `IPv4`
  - Uses 32 bits
  - 4 Octals 八进制
- `IPv6`

  - Uses 128 bits
  - encompass the `Internet of Things (IoT)`

- `Internet of Things ( IoT )`
  - Connecting everyday items, devices, objects, etc. to a network so that they can **communicate and send data** to other devices on the network
    - Cars communicating with each other on the road
    - Houseplants letting you know through email that they need water
    - Your fridge telling you to buy more milk
    - Alexa telling you the news & weather… etc.

## Components of Web Apps

- Anything can be a web server…
- Most common web servers will listen to traffic on `port 80 (HTTP)` or `port 443(HTTPS)`
- Web Servers

  - LAMP
    - operating system, `Linux`;
    - the web server, `Apache`;
    - the database server,`MySQL`;
    - and the programming language, `PHP`.
  - IIS
    - `Internet Information Services`

- **Markup languages**

  - SGML
  - HTML
  - XML
  - XHTML
  - CSS

- Scripting Languages

  - JavaScript
  - JS
  - JSON
  - AJAX

- Backend (Server Side) Languages

  - PHP
  - Python
  - Perl
  - Ruby
  - ASP
  - .NET

- Databases
  - MS SQL
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Oracle
  - MariaDB

## The Changing landscape of Web Apps

- Web applications have become a lot more **complex**
  - Importing scripts
  - Linking to analytic servers
  - Advertisements
  - User input
- All the extra code required for **user engagement** also creates an opportunity for exploitation

- As opposed to being static web sites, most are now complex Web applications that **require user input**

  - Login/Authentication
  - E-Commerce
  - Online Banking
  - Social Media
  - User created content
  - Forums

- Most web applications now have **different interfaces** for **various platforms**
  - Mobile Apps
  - Use HTTP-based APIs
- **Business software** that used to be accessed through a network computer can now be accessed **through web apps**
  - Outlook Web Access / Office 365
  - Google Apps
  - SaaS

## User Input

- Malicious users can **alter data** being sent to a server through:

  - Request **parameters**
  - **Cookies**
  - HTTP **headers**

- These can be done using **automated tools** in addition to manual input manipulation

---

## OSI Model

## Web App Security

- SSL does not stop a malicious user from altering the data a server is expecting

  - **Hidden HTML** form fields
  - Modified **session tokens**
  - Tampering with **parameters**
  - **Injection** attacks

- Adding functionality to web applications increases their attack surface
- More lines of code = More potential vulnerabilities
  - Password recovery
  - Username recovery
  - Password hints
  - Etc
