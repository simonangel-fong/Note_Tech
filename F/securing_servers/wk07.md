## Identity Management

- A centralized, automated approach to provide enterprise wide access to resources by employees and other authorized individuals

  - **Focus** is **defining an identity** for each user (human or process), associating attributes with the identity, and enforcing a means by which a user can verify identity
  - **Central concept** is the **use of `single sign-on (SSO)`** which enables a user to access all network resources after a single authentication

- Principal elements of an identity management system:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Accounting
  - Provisioning
  - Workflow automation
  - Delegated administration
  - Password synchronization
  - Self-service password reset
  - Federation

## NIST Model: Digital Identity Guidelines

- `NIST SP 800-63-3` June 2017 Digital Identity Guidelines (formerly Electronic Authentication Guideline, 2013), **define technical requirements** in each of the areas of identity proofing, registration, authenticators, management processes, authentication protocols, federation, and related assertions.

- `Identity Assurance Level (IAL)`: identity proofing process.
- `Authentication Assurance Level (AAL)`: authentication process.
- `Federation Assurance Level (FAL)`: the strength of an assertion in a federated environment
- `Credential Service Provider (CSP)`: a trusted entity that issues or registers subscriber authenticators

- authentication or authorized function can take place across an open network
  - authentication and subsequent authorization can take place **locally**, such as across a local area network

---

- various states of an identity proofing and authentication process and the usual sequence of interactions is as follows:
  - 1. An applicant **applies** to a `CSP` through an enrollment process.
  - 2. The `CSP` identity **proofs** that applicant.
    - Upon successful proofing, the applicant becomes a **subscriber**.
  - 3. Authenticator(s) and a corresponding credential are **established** between the CSP and the subscriber.
  - 4. The `CSP` **maintains** the credential, its status, and the enrollment data collected for the lifetime of the credential (at a minimum).
    - The subscriber maintains his or her authenticator(s).

---

- using an authenticator to **perform digital authentication**.
  - A `subscriber` is referred to as a `claimant` when they need to authenticate to a verifier.
  - The interactions are as follows:
    - 1. The `claimant` **proves** possession and control of the **authenticator(s)** to the verifier through an authentication protocol.
    - 2. The `verifier` interacts with the `CSP` to **validate** the credential that binds the subscriber’s identity to their authenticator and to optionally obtain `claimant` attributes. 向第三方验证
    - 3. The `CSP` or `verifier` provides an **assertion** about the subscriber to the RP, which may use the information in the assertion to make an authorization decision.
    - 4. An **authenticated session** is **established** between the subscriber and the RP.

### User Authentication Principles

- In most computer security contexts, user authentication is the fundamental building block and the primary line of defense
- `User authentication` is the basis for most types of **access control** and for **user accountability**.
- `RFC 4949` (Internet Security Glossary) defines user authentication as the process of verifying an identity claimed by or for a system entity
  - **Identification step**
    - Presenting an identifier to the security system
    - A 3rd party is an Identifying Party (IdP)
  - **Verification step**
    - Presenting or generating authentication information that corroborates the binding between the entity and the identifier
    - A 3rd party is a Verification Party (VP)

---

### Means of Authentication

- There are **four** general means of authenticating a user’s identity, which can be used alone or in combination
  - Something the **individual knows**
    - Examples include a **password**, a personal identification number (**PIN**), or **answers** to a prearranged set of questions
  - Something the **individual possesses**
    - Examples include **cryptographic keys**, electronic **keycards**, smart **cards**, and physical **keys**
    - This type of authenticator is referred to as a **token**
  - Something the **individual** is (static **biometrics**)
    - Examples include recognition by **fingerprint**, **retina**, and **face**
  - Something the individual **does** (**dynamic** biometrics)
    - Examples include recognition by **voice** pattern, **handwriting** characteristics, and **typing** rhythm

---

### Multi-Factor Authentication

- The **strength** of the authentication process is described by an ordinal measurement called the `AAL(Authentication Assurance Level)`.
  - `AAL1` requires **single**-factor authentication and is permitted with a variety of different authenticator types.
  - `AAL2`, authentication requires **two** authentication factors for additional security.
  - `AAL3`, additionally requires the use of a **hardware**-based authenticator (token generator) and verifier impersonation resistance. (**biometrics**)

## Key Distribution

### Symmetric Encryption

- Symmetric Encryption:
  - Utilizes the **same key** for Cryptography
- For symmetric encryption to work, the two parties to an exchange must **share the same key**, and that key must be protected from access by others
- **Frequent key changes** are usually desirable to limit the amount of data compromised if an attacker learns the key
- Key distribution technique:
  - The means of delivering a key to two parties that wish to exchange data, without allowing others to see the key

---

### Examples of Assertions

- `Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions` are specified **using a mark-up language** intended for describing security assertions.
  - They can be **used by a verifier** to make a statement to an RP about the identity of a claimant. SAML assertions may optionally be digitally signed.
- `OpenID Connect claims` are specified using `JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)` for describing security, and optionally, user claims.
  - JSON user info claims may **optionally** be **digitally signed.**
- `Kerberos tickets` allow a **ticket-granting authority** to **issue session keys** to two authenticated parties using **symmetric** key based encapsulation schemes.

---

## Kerberos

- **Key distribution** and **user authentication service** developed at MIT
- Provides a **centralized authentication server** whose function is to **authenticate** users to servers and servers to users
- Relies exclusively on **symmetric** encryption, making **no** use of **public-key** encryption

- 2 versions:
  - Version 4 implementations still exist, although this version is being phased out
  - Version **5** corrects some of the security deficiencies of version 4 and has been issued as a proposed Internet Standard (RFC 4120)

---

### Kerberos - version 4

- Abasic third-party authentication scheme:
  - `Authentication Server (AS)`
    - Users **initially** negotiate with AS to identify self
    - AS **provides** a non-corruptible authentication **credential** (ticket granting ticket TGT)
  - `Ticket Granting Server (TGS)`
    - Users subsequently **request** access to other services from TGS on basis of users TGT
  - Complex protocol using `DES`

---

### Kerberos Realms

- `Kerberos realm`
  - A set of managed **nodes** that **share** the same Kerberos **database**
- The **Kerberos database** resides on the Kerberos **master** computer system, which should be kept in a physically secure room
- A **read-only copy** of the Kerberos database might also reside on **other** Kerberos computer systems
- All **changes** to the database must be made on the **master** computer system
- Changing or accessing the contents of a Kerberos database requires the Kerberos **master password**

- A Kerberos environment consists of:
  - A Kerberos server
  - A number of clients
  - A number of application servers

---

### Kerberos Principal 主体

- A `Kerberos principal` is a service or user that is **known** to the Kerberos system.
- Each `Kerberos principal` is identified by its **principal name**
- **Principal names** consist of three parts:

  - a service or user name,
  - an instance name,
  - a realm name

- `service or user name` + `instance name` + `realm name` = `Principal name`
- `service-name.instance-name@realm-name`

  - e.g.: a user principal = `joe.user@realm1`

- A `principal name` can also describe the **location of a service** on a computer system。

  - e.g., `ftp.host1@realm2` for a **service principal**.

- The **instance part** of the principal name is **optional** but is useful for identifying the computer system on which a service resides.
- Kerberos considers **identical** services on **different** computer systems to be **different** service principals. 不同机器上的相同服务都是不同主题。

  - **Session** keys
  - Password **attacks**

## Key Distribution - Asymmetric Encryption

- One of the major roles of public-key encryption is to address the problem of key distribution
- There are two distinct aspects to the use of public-key encryption in this regard:
  - The **distribution** of `public keys`
  - The use of `public-key` encryption to distribute secret keys
- **`Public-key` certificate**
  - Consists of a `public key` plus a `user ID` of the key owner, with the whole block signed by a trusted third party
  - Typically, the third party is a `certificate authority (CA)` that is trusted by the user community, such as a government agency or a financial institution
  - A user can **present** his or her `public key` to the authority in a secure manner and **obtain a certificate**
  - The user can then **publish** the certificate
  - Anyone needing this user’s public key can obtain the certificate and verify that it is valid by way of the attached trusted signature

---

### X.509 Certificates

- ITU-T recommendation `X.509` is part of the X.500 series of recommendations that define a directory service
- Defines a framework for the provision of authentication services by the X.500 directory to its users
- The **directory** may serve as a **repository** of `public-key` certificates
- Defines alternative authentication **protocols** based on the use of public-key **certificates**
- Was initially issued in 1988
- Based on the use of public-key cryptography and digital signatures
- The standard does not dictate the use of a specific algorithm but **recommends** `RSA`

---

### Obtaining a user’s certificate

- User certificates generated by a CA have the following **characteristics**:
  - **Any user** with access to the public key of the CA can **verify the user `public key`** that was certified
  - **No** party other than the certification authority can **modify** the certificate without this being detected
  - Because certificates are **unforgeable**, they **can be placed in a directory** without the need for the directory to make special efforts to protect them

---

### Revocation of certificates

- Each certificate includes a **period of validity**
- Typically a new certificate is **issued just before the expiration** of the old one
- It may be desirable on occasion to **revoke a certificate** before it expires for one of the following reasons:
  - The user’s `private key` is assumed to be **compromised**
  - The user is **no longer certified** by this CA;
    - reasons for this include subject’s name has changed, the certificate is superseded, or the certificate was not issued in conformance with the CA’s policies
  - The CA’s **certificate** is assumed to be **compromised**

---

### Key and Policy Information

- These extensions convey additional information about the subject and issuer keys, plus indicators of certificate policy
- Acertificate policy is a named set of rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate to a particular community and/or class of application with common security requirements
- Includes:
  - Authority key identifier
  - Subject key identifier
  - Key usage
  - Private-key usage period
  - Certificate policies
  - Policy mappings
