## Threat Protection

-` Windows Server 2016` now includes `Windows Defender Antivirus`

- ## a few key differences:

Antivirus.

- `Windows Defender AV`:
  - malware protection that immediately and actively protects Windows Server 2016 against known malware and can regularly update anti- malware definitions through Windows Update.
- You can configure Windows Defender Antivirus with a number of tools:
  - Microsoft Intune
  - System Center Configuration Manager
  - Group Policy
  - PowerShell cmdlets
  - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
- The following broad categories of features can be configured:
  - **Cloud**-delivered protection
  - Always-on **real-time protection**, including behavioral, heuristic, and **machine-learning-based** protection
  - How end-users **interact** with the client on individual endpoints

## Windows Defender

- a few key differences:
  - In **Windows Server 2016**, **automatic exclusions** are applied based on your defined **Server Role**.
- In Windows Server **2016**, Windows Defender AV will **not disable** itself if you are running another antivirus product.

- Steps for setting up and running Windows Defender AV on a server platform:

1. Enable the interface: GUI & PowerShell
2. Verify Windows Defender AV is running
3. Update anti-malware Security intelligence
4. Submit Samples
5. Configure automatic exclusions

- - Windows Defender AV will **still run normally without** the user interface, but the user interface cannot be enabled if you disable the core Windows Defender feature.
- Uninstall: Remove Roles and Features Wizard

```powershell
# powershell
get-service -name windefend     #  defender
get-service -name mpssvc        # firewall protection

# cmd
sc query Windefend
```

- To get updated anti-malware Security intelligence
  - need `Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)`
- - `Group Policy`.

  - You can set up and manage Windows Update by using the settings available in Group Policy,
  - AUOptions registry key
    - `#4` Install updates automatically.
    - `#3` Download updates but let me choose

- recommend that you enable:

  - `Windows Error Reporting service`
  - `Windows Update service`

- `Sample submission`
  - allows Microsoft to collect samples of potentially malicious software.
- - To enable automatic sample submission

  - powershell to set the `SubmitSamplesConsent`
    - 0 Always prompt.
    - 1 Send safe samples automatically
    - 2 Never send.
    - 3 Send all samples automatically.

- `exclusions`

  - to help ensure security and performance,
  - automatically added
  - not appear in the standard exclusion lists
  - can still add or remove custom exclusions
    - Custom exclusions > automatic exclusions
  - the predefined exclusions only exclude default paths

- `Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tools`

  - used to to determine which roles are installed on your computer.

- `List of automatic exclusions`

  - file paths and file types.
  - Default exclusions for all roles
  - System Exclusions
  - Server Role Exclusions
    - Active Directory / Domain Services exclusions

- **disable** the auto exclusions list using

  - Group Policy,
  - PowerShell cmdlets,
  - and WMI.

- Exclusion Process **Summary**
  - Configure and validate exclusions for Windows Defender Antivirus **scans**
  - Configure and validate exclusions based on file **name**, **extension**, and folder **location**
  - Configure and validate exclusions for files opened by **processes**
  - Customize, initiate, and review the results of Windows Defender Antivirus scans and **remediation**

---

- `Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)`
  - a unified platform for preventative protection(预防性保护), post-breach detection, automated investigation, and response.
  - Microsoft Defender ATP **protects** endpoints from cyber threats; detects advanced attacks and data breaches, automates security incidents and improves security posture.

## Encrypting File System

- `Encrypting File System`

  - EFS
  - Windows feature that allows a user to setup folders and files to be **encrypted**
  - Other users on the computer can **not view the encrypted** file contents
  - Once encrypted, **cannot** be copied or accessed if **shared** on the network

- `cipher` command

  - `cipher /w`: used to securely wipe a hard drive's free space

- Set encryption property on folders **not files**

  - All files placed in folder are automatically encrypted

- A randomly generated **symmetric encryption key** is generated
- symmetric because it takes **less time** to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an asymmetric key cipher is used
- Known as the `FEK` (`File Encryption Key`)

- The `FEK` is then **encrypted** with a `public key` that is associated with the **user** who encrypted the file, and this encrypted FEK is **stored in the data stream** of the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, the EFS uses the `private key` that matches the `EFS digital certificate` (used to encrypt the file) to decrypt the symmetric key that is stored in the data stream

- Files and folders are decrypted before being copied to a volume formatted with another file system 先解密后复制
- When **encrypted** files are **copied over the network** using the SMB protocol, the files are **decrypted before** they are **sent** over the network.

### Recovery Agent

- `Recovery Agent`
  - A user, usually the local system administrator can be set up to **recover encrypted files** 用于恢复文件
- Once the `recovery agent` on the local computer is created its **attribute** is added to the **encryption**
- If the user that created the file leaves the company the designated recovery agent can used to retrieve/decrypt the files

- The **security certificate** of the `recovery agent` and `private key` should **not be stored** on the local computer 异地存储
  - **Delete** recovery agent **credentials** from the local machine
  - Recovery Agents private key should be **exported**, moved off server to **remote** secure location
