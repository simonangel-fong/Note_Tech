## Interface

### Interface Groups

- Interfaces allow pfSense software to communicate with different networks.
- Different interfaces employ different protocols/connections to establish connectivity between itself and other networks

- **Types of Interfaces** in pfSense
  - VLAN Trunking
  - LAGG Interfaces - link aggregation and link failover interface
  - GIF Interfaces – (GIF means “**Generic tunnel InterFace**”)
  - GRE Interfaces – Generic Routing Encapsulation
  - Interface **Bridges** - multiple interfaces **tied together into a shared L2 broadcast domain**
  - Interface Groups – These are what we will discuss today
  - QinQ Interfaces - allows multiple `802.11q VLAN` tags to be contained in a single packet
  - PPP Interfaces – Point-to-point protocol (L2) direct link between two routers

---

- `Interface Groups`

  - are used to **apply firewall or NAT rules** to a **group of interfaces** that have a similar function and rules

- `Interface Groups` are used to **add rules to all** of the interfaces at the same time
- **Group rules** are processed **AFTER** `floating rules` but **before** `tab rules`.
- Interfaces **can** still have **individual rules**, which are processed **after** the group rules.

- The rule **processing order** for user rules is:

  - `floating tab rules` are processed first
  - Then rules defined on interface `group tabs` (including `IPsec` and `OpenVPN`) are processed
  - Rules defined on `interface tabs` (WAN, LAN, OPTx, etc) are processed last

- **Important Notes**

- A **general blocking rule** in a group will **not override** a specific `interface rule` (ind’l before group)
- An `interface rule` **cannot block allowed traffic** on a `group rule` (first match wins)
- Do **not** use `interface groups` with **multiple** `WANs`.
- The `Wireless tab` under Interfaces > (assign) is used to create/manage additional `VAP interfaces`
- `VLAN tagged interfaces` and `802.1Q tagged interfaces` are located on the VLANs tab under Interfaces > (assign).
- VLAN instances allow the system to address traffic tagged by an 802.1Q capable switch.
- After An OpenVPN instance is created, it may be assigned under Interfaces > (assign).
  - `OpenVPN interfaces` **enable** `interface-specific rules`
  - This allows the interface to be used elsewhere in the GUI.
  - This also triggers that creation of a dynamic gateway that can be used for policy routing.

---

### PPoE

- `Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet(PPoE)`
  - Encapsulates PPP frames inside Ethernet frames
  - PPPoE is often used by **ISP’s offering** DSL as it allows for **multiple connections to authenticate** to a **single server**

### Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)

- Originally designed by Cisco (1994). Operates on the **network layer (L3)**
- `GRE` is used to **tunnel traffic** between two endpoints **without encryption**.
- Routing packets between two locations that are **not directly connected** and **do not require encryption**.
- `Standards-compliant` means of **tunneling traffic** (simple and easy, but **not secure**)
- IPsec in **transport mode** can use GRE for **tunneling encrypted traffic**
- In pfSense, `GRE Tunnels` are **managed from the list view** (there is no general tab for GRE traffic)

---

## User Management and Authentication

- **Why might you want to have multiple users on pfSense?**
  - **Security** through **confidentiality** and **control**
  - **Accountability** through **auditing** specific users
  - **Non-admin access** allows for **separation of duties**
  - **Personalization** – accommodates users with different **preferences**
  - **Integration** with **existing authentication** structure (LDAP, AD, RADIUS, etc)

---

### User Management

- **Privileges** can be set **per user** or **by user group**

  - TIP: Build and save the user(or group) first, THEN customize the privileges
  - Do **NOT** “**select all**” in privileges – some p**rivileges will conflict!**

- User accounts can **expire** based on **date** or by a **manual action** of an admin
- **Menus** are customized to a user **based on their privileges**

  - If user doesn’t have dashboard access, they see **first page in their privilege list**
  - **Highly customizable** right down to the **page** the user can see on the UI
  - Can customize views/widgets/themes

- `Users and groups` are **managed** under the `User Manage`r located at **System > User Manager**.

- Groups speed up the process of adding users, but are **less personalized**
- Groups are used to manage **sets of permissions for multiple users**

---

### Best Practices

- Rules

  - `Least privilege` is a good philosophy with firewalls
    - **Default Deny** (instead of default allow)
  - The **shorter** the ruleset, the **easier** it is to manage
  - **Manually Review** the Firewall Rules (recommended **quarterly** or **semi-annually**)
    - Environment changes, servers get removed,
  - **Document** the configuration!
    - Use the **description field** in the firewall and NAT rules
    - **Update** the config documentation **regularly**

- Log

  - **Reduce log noise**.
    - Watch for something spamming the logs.
    - Check the firewall **logs** under **Status > System Logs > Firewall tab** to see what kind of traffic the firewall is **blocking**, and review how often it appears in the log.

- User management

  - **Reduce** or eliminate **use of the "admin" account**
  - Give each person their **own account**, **no sharing** or **role-based accounts**!
  - Never leave system **passwords** at their **default value**
  - Encourage use of **long passwords** (bcrypt supports up to **72** character passwords)
  - **Remove** accounts promptly when a user **leaves** the company
  - Set an **expiration date** and/or disable accounts that only need **temporary access**

- Connection

  - **Do not expose** GUI or SSH services to the world
  - Only use **encrypted protocols** (HTTPS, SSH, no HTTP!)
    - Refer to the ACME/Let's Encrypt hangout to get a trusted HTTPS GUI Certificate
  - Use **key-based** authentication for `SSH`
  - Use **remote access VPNs** for management where possible

- physical security
  - Don't ignore **physical security**!
  - Disabling console access is OK, but not perfect, can be reset/bypassed by someone with physical access and control of the hardware

## RADIUS, LDAP, and AD

- Note: pfSense can also use **Google Authenticator**

### Authentication Servers

- `Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)`
  - is used to **provide AAA**
- `Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)`

  - is a big directory that binds to **authentication services** (most commonly `Active Directory`)

- `pfSense` uses these services to control/enrol users’ GUI access
  - **Authentication servers** are configured under **System > User Manager > Authentication Servers**
  - Click Add to add a new server
  - `RADIUS` and `LDAP` can be used for **VPN access** (OpenVPN and/or IKEv2 IPSec), and for **Wireless** WPA2 Enterprise/802.1x

---

- Both provide `AAA` – `Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting`
- Can be **compatible** with **external** systems for additional authentication
- Protocol itself is **not encrypted**, so ideally try to run it **locally** or over a **VPN**
- `RADIUS` and `LDAP` can be used for **GUI authentication** and **VPN authentication**
- `RADIUS` can also be used for **wireless** authentication

- Can you use `RADIUS` and/or `LDAP` for **SSH** authentication?
  - **No**

---

### RADIUS server

- **Shared Secret**: The password established for this firewall on the RADIUS server software
- **Services offered**: sets the services are offered by the RADIUS server.
  - Authentication and Accounting ,
  - Authentication only,
  - or Accounting only.
- Port
  - Authentication port is `1812`.
  - Accounting port is `1813`.
- **Authentication Timeout** in seconds the RADIUS server may take to respond to an authentication request.
  - The default is **5 seconds**.

---

### LDAP

- A **repository** of information about users, and is used for authentication via `LDAP BIND` operations
  - Commonly used not just for authentication but also for **e-mail contact storage**, **user profile** information, and similar tasks.
- Available in most systems as `OpenLDAP`, `Active Directory`, `Apple Open Directory`, and many more
- `LDAP Schemas` vary widely, two common variations:
  - RFC 2307bis (`Active Director`y) – **User** object
  - RFC 2307 (`OpenLDAP` default) – **Group** object
- Can use **SSL** to **encrypt** LDAP queries from the firewall, or use plan TCP (clear text!)

- **Configuring LDAP**
  - **Port value**
    - 389/TCP, 636/ssl
  - Protocol version: 3

---

## Certificate Authority Management

### Certificate Authorities

- Certificates provide a framework for **public key infrastructure (PKI)**
- `X.509` standard defines the format for the certificates
- Certificates include:

  - the **public key** being certified
  - **identifying information** about the entity that owns the public key
  - **metadata** relating to the digital certificate
  - a **digital signature** of the public key created by the issuer of the certificate.

- Certificate Authorities (CAs) are managed from **System > Cert Manager**, on the **CAs tab**.

---

### create a new CA

- Method

  - Create an **Internal** Certificate Authority(most common)
  - Create an **Intermediate** Certificate Authority
  - Import an **Existing** Certificate Authority

#### Create an **Internal** Certificate Authority:

- **Key length**: **default** value of **2048**
- **Digest Algorithm**: SHA256
- avoid using spaces in the **Common Name**

#### Existing Authority

#### Intermediate Certificate Authority

- Intermediate CA
  - create a new CA that is capable of generating certificates, yet **depends on another CA higher above it**.
  - The higher-level CA must **already exist** on the firewall (Created or imported)

#### Edit, Export, and Remove Authority

### Certificate Management

- **Method**

  - Import an **Existing** Certificate
  - Create an **Internal** Certificate
  - Create a **Certificate Signing Request**

- Removing a Certificate

### User Certificates

- **No Authentication** or **External Authentication**
  - If there is **no user authentication**, or if the user authentication is being performed on an **external server** (RADIUS, LDAP, etc) then make a user certificate like any other certificate described earlier.
  - Ensure that User Certificate is selected for the Certificate Type and set the **Common Name** to be the **user’s username**.
- Local Authentication / Create Certificate **When Creating a User**

  - If user authentication is being performed on the firewall the user certificate is created in the **User Manager**.

- Local Authentication / **Add** a Certificate to an **Existing User**

---

### Certificate Revocation

- `Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)`
  - lists of certificates that should no longer be trusted.
- pfsense can use **multiple** CRLs

### Export, Delete, or Revoke Certificates
