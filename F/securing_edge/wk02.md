## Basic Interface Configuration

- Security zones
- Interface types:
  - TAP mode
  - Decrypt mirror
  - Virtual wire
  - Layer 2
  - Layer 3:
    - Virtual router
    - IP addressing
    - DHCP
- VLAN Interface
  - Loopback
  - Aggregate

---

## Security Zones

- Specify zone **name**
- Specify zone **type**
- Assign **interface**

- `Security policies`

  - use zones to regulate and log traffic:
  - **Intrazone traffic** is **allowed** by default
  - **Interzone traffic** is **denied** by default

- `Security Zone Interfaces`
  - An `interface` is configured to **only one** `zone`.
  - A `security zone` can have **multiple** `interfaces`.

---

## Interface Types

- Interface Types
  - Ethernet:
    - TAP
    - HA
    - Virtual wire
    - Layer 2
    - Layer 3
    - Aggregate
    - Decrypt mirror
- VLAN
- Loopback
- Tunnel

---

### Ethernet - TAP Mode (report)

- `TAP mode` deployment allows passive **monitoring of traffic flows** across a network by way of a switch SPAN or mirror port.
- The **firewall cannot** perform traffic shaping or blocking.
- `Tap interfaces` must be assigned to a `security zone` for ACC and **reporting** capabilities.

---

### Ethernet - Virtual Wire (multicast firewalling)

- Binds **two** physical interfaces together
- Supports App-ID, decryption, NAT, Content-ID, and User-ID
- Typically used **when no switching or routing is needed**
- No configuration changes for adjacent network devices

- A virtual wire can **allow or block traffic** based on 802.1Q VLAN tags:
  - 0 = untagged traffic
- Applies **security rules** to **multicast traffic**, enables **multicast firewalling**

---

### Virtual Wire Subinterfaces

- Provide flexibility in **setting distinct policies** when needed to manage traffic from **multitenancy networks**
- Allow for the **assignment of incoming traffic** to different ingress and egress **security zones** by either:
  - VLAN tags
  - VLAN tags and IP classifiers (source IP)
- Traffic from **different VLANs** can now be assigned to **different zone**s and then managed by different **security policies**
- Traffic from different VLANs can be assigned to **different ports**:
  - Voice VLAN can be assigned to one port, and data VLAN to another

---

### Layer 2 and Layer 3

- A `Layer 2` port uses **physical addresses** and is used for communicating between devices **on the same IP network**.
  - It is used for **switching** and can't be used to send data to other IP networks.
- A `Layer 3` port uses **logical addresses** and is used for communicating between devices on **different IP networks**.
  - It is used for **routing**.

---

### Layer 3 Interface

- Interface Type: `Layer 3`
- Security zone
- IP address:
  - **Static** or **DHCP** client
  - DHCP **server** or DHCP **relay**
- `Interface management profile`:
  - Allows or denies management protocols such as SSH and HTTP on the MGT interface
  - Defines which **management functions** are allowed on a traffic interface
  - Management profiles are applied to `Layer 3` interfaces
- `Virtual router`:
  - Contains a set of static and dynamic **routes** used by a specified **group of interfaces**
  - All interfaces assigned to a v`irtual router` share the **same routing table**:
    - The routing table of a virtual router can be defined by static and dynamic (RIP, OSPF, BGP) routes.
    - Allows for the configuration of different routing behavior for different interfaces.

---

#### Policy-Based Forwarding Source

- Source:
  - Source **address**
  - Source **zone**
  - Source **user**
- Destination
  - Destination **address**
  - Destination **application**
  - Destination **service** (port number)

---

#### IPv6 Interface

- IPv6 Features

  - GlobalProtect VPNs are not supported

- Dual stack support
  - You can have IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on the same interface.

---

#### DHCP Server

- When an interface is configured as a `DHCP server`, it **assigns addresses** to DHCP clients.

- If an interface on the firewall is a client of an **external DHCP server**, the DHCP server can **inherit this information** and forward it to clients.

---

## VLAN Interfaces

### Loopback Interfaces

### Aggregate Interfaces

- An aggregate interface group combines up to **eight Ethernet interfaces** using **link aggregation**.
- Increased throughput and link redundancy.
- The aggregate interface is a logical interface that can be configured as if it were a regular interface.
- LACP is supported.

---

## Palo Alto Platforms andArchitecture (Security Platform overview)

- Next-Generation Security Platform
- `NGFW`
  - Identifies the network traffic.
- `Threat Intelligence Cloud` - `AutoFocus/WildFire`
  - Correlates threats, gather information from multiple sources.
- `Advanced Endpoint Protection`

  - Block malicious at the endpoint.

- `Unified Threat Management (UTM)`

### Palo Alto Networks: Single Pass Architecture

- `Single Pass` (Palo Alto Networks)

  - Operations per packet
    - Traffic classification with **App-ID**
    - **User/group** mapping
    - **Content** scanning - threats, URLs, confidential data
  - All in one **Security Policy**
  - One OS **Update** for the Firewall

- Parallel Processing

  - Function-specific **parallel processing** hardware engines
  - Separate data/control planes

- `Zero Trust Model`:
  - NEVER TRUST, ALWAYS VERIFY.

---

## Initial Configuration

- Configuring the Static MGT Interface(CLI)
  - `configure`

---

### Initial System Access

- Four ways to access firewall management.

  - Web UI
  - SSH/Console CLI
  - Panorama
  - REST XML API

- Resetting to Factory Default

  - CLI: `request system private-data-reset`
  - Erases all **logs**
  - Resets all **settings**, including IP addressing, which causes loss of connectivity
  - Saves a **default configuration** after the MGT IP address is changed

- Without known admin user password:
  - From the console port, type maint during bootup
  - Choose Reset to Factory Default

---

## MGT Interface Configuration

- Firewall can identify itself to the DHCP server with hostname or client ID (MAC).

---

### Configure the Hostname and Domain

- DHCP can provide the firewall hostname and domain.

---

### Configuration Management

- **Config Types**

  - Candidate Configuration
    - What is shown in the UI becomes the running config upon successful **commit**.
  - Running Configuration
    - **Active** on the firewall.

- **Transaction Locks**

  - `Config lock`:
    - **Blocks other administrators** from making **changes to the configuration**
  - `Commit lock`:
    - Blocks other administrators from **committing changes** until all of the locks have been released

- **Auditing**
  - Any two configuration files can be compared.

---

### Licensing and Software Updates

- Rapid Mass Deployment
  - When the firewall is at factory-default, it can bootstrap from an **external** virtual or physical USB device.
- Without contacting the update server, the firewall can now perform:
  - Licensing
  - Content and software updates
  - Addressing
  - System configuration
  - Connection to Panorama
- The firewall can now boot up and connect itself to the network and to a Panorama management server.

---

### Account Administration

- Administrator Roles
  - Roles define the type of access an administrator has on the firewall:
    - **Dynamic Roles**: Built-in roles such as superuser and device administrator
    - **Admin Role Profiles**: Custom-made roles

---

- Using External AAA to Authenticate Admin Users

- Creating Administrator Accounts
