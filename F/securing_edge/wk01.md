## Edge Security Overview

- three points of attack:
  - The data
  - The network
  - The people

---

### Assessing Network Threats

- These are the two ends of the spectrum

  - 1. There is **no** real threat, nothing to worry about
  - 2. Extreme alarm: all hackers are experts and out to break into my network

- The only practical approach is the realistic one

  - a **moderate solution** to the two extremes

- Classifying Threats:
- Intrusion 入侵
  - Cracking 破解
  - Social engineering
  - War-dialing
  - Wardriving
- Blocking
  - Denial of Service (DoS)
  - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- Malware 恶意软件
  - Viruses
  - Worms
  - Trojan horses
  - Spyware 间谍软件
    - Cookies
    - Key loggers

---

- Threat Assessment Factors & Vulnerability Score

  - Attractiveness 1-10
  - Information content 1-10
  - Security devices 1-10

- The equation is: `(A + I) – S = V` (vulnerability score)
- Lower score indicates lower risk

---

---

### Network Security

- Proactive versus reactive

- Three possible approaches:

1. Perimeter 边界: Focus is on **perimeter devices**; internal devices are still vulnerable
2. Layered 分层: Focus includes **both** perimeter and individual computers within the network
3. Hybrid: Combination of **multiple** security paradigms

---

## Firewalls

- Firewall?
  - A barrier between the world and your network
- Provided via:

  - Packet **filtering**
  - **Stateful** packet filtering
  - User **authentication**
  - Client **application** authentication

### Generations

- First generation: **Packet** Filters
- Second Generation: **Stateful** Filters
- Third Generation: **Application** Layer
- Fourth Generation: `Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)`

---

#### First Generation

- First generation: **Packet** Filters

  - Packet filters **inspect packets** transferred between computers.
  - When a packet does **not match** the **filtering rules**
  - The packet filter either **accepts** or **rejects** the packet
  - Packets may be filtered by source and destination network **address**, **protocol**, source and destination **ports**.

- **Disadvantages**
  - Does **not compare** packets
  - No **authentication**
  - Susceptible to **SYN and Ping flood attacks**
  - Does **not track** packets
  - Does not look at the packet data, **just the header**
  - Not necessarily the most secure firewall

#### Second Generation

- Second Generation: **Stateful** Packet Inspection

  - These firewalls perform the functions of the first generation
  - Maintains a **database of conversations** between the endpoints – specifically **port numbers** the two IP addresses
  - Being aware of the **context of packets** makes them less susceptible to flood attacks
  - Knows if packet is part of a **larger stream**
  - Recognizes whether **source IP is within the firewall**
  - Can look at the **contents** of the packet

- When possible, the recommended firewall solution
- Uses the **transport layer (layer 4)** / TCP, UDP
- **Vulnerable to DoS attacks**

---

##### State Machine Model

- Looks at the **state of a machine** from one time period to the next
- Determines security violation based on the **comparison**
- Several ways are used to evaluate the **state** of the system:
  - Users
  - States
  - Commands
  - Output

---

#### Third Generation

- Third Generation: **Application Layer**

  - Also known as `application proxy` or `application-level proxy`
  - Examines the connection between the client and the server **applications**
  - Enables administrators to specify what **applications** are allowed
  - Allows for **user authentication**
  - Application layer filtering that understands common **applications** and **protocols** (such as File `Transfer Protocol (FTP)`, `Domain Name System (DNS)`, or `Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP)`)
  - **Detects unwanted** applications and services are attempting to bypass the firewall

- **Disadvantages**
  - Requires more system **resources**
  - Susceptible to **flooding** attacks (SYN and Ping)
  - Due to **time** it takes to authenticate user
  - When connection is made, packets are **not checked**

---

#### Fourth Generation

- Fourth Generation: `Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)`
- Provide wider and deeper inspection at the application layer.
- `Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)`
- **Identity** management
- `Web application firewall (WAF)`

### Other Edge Protection Devices (IDS vs IPS)

- Intrusion **Detection** System
  - **Passive**
  - **Logs** the activity
  - Alerts an administrator (perhaps)
- Intrusion **Prevention** System
  - **Active**
  - Takes steps to prevent an attack in progress
  - Problem of **false positives**

---

### Solutions - Implementing Firewalls

- Most common solutions
  - Network host-based
  - Dual-homed host 双宿主机
  - Router-based firewall
  - Screened host

#### Network Host-Based

- **Software-based solution** runs on top of operating system
- Must harden the operating system in the following ways:
  - Ensure all **patches** are **updated**
  - **Uninstall** unneeded applications or utilities
  - **Close** unused ports
  - Turn off all unused **services**
- Cheap solution

---

#### Dual-Homed Hosts

- Expanded version of the Network host firewall
- Also runs on top of an existing OS
- The biggest **disadvantage**
  - as with Network host firewalls – is its **reliance on the security of the OS**

---

#### Router-Based Firewall

- Router-based firewalls are most often the first line of defense
- They use simple **packet filtering**
- Ideal for novice administrators
- Can be preconfigured by vendor for specific needs of user
- Can be **placed between segments of a network**

---

#### Screened Host

- A combination of firewalls
- **Bastion host** and **screening router** is used
- Similar in concept to the dual-homed host

---

#### In Practice: Utmost Security

- Multiple firewalls
  - **Stateful** packet inspecting firewall
  - **Application** gateway
- **Screened firewall routers** separating each network segment
- **Dual-perimeter firewall**, packet screening on all routers, individual packet filtering firewalls on every server

---

### DMZ

- Demilitarized Zone
  - Can be implemented using one or two separate firewalls
  - One faces the **outside** world
  - One faces the **inside**
  - Web, email, and FTP servers are located in the area in-between them

---

### Network Address Translation (NAT)

- Translates **internal** IP addresses to **public** addresses
- Can explicitly **map ports** to **internal addresses** for web servers
- Supersedes proxy servers 取代代理服务器

---

### Zero Trust

- `Zero Trust`
  - a **security model** originally proposed by John Kindervag in 2010
  - Suggested a new security paradigm of “designing from the inside out.”
  - Provides optimization of network security and future flexibility
- Traditional security model uses outside, DMZ, and inside or red, yellow, green

- a `zero trust network` is built upon five fundamental assertions:
  1. The network is always assumed to be **hostile**
  2. **External and internal threats** exist on the network at all times
  3. Network **locality is not sufficient** for deciding trust in a network
  4. Every device **user, and network flow** is **authenticated** and **authorized**
  5. **Policies must be dynamic and calculated** from as many sources of data as possible.

## Types of Attacks

### Denial of Service Attacks

- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- SYN Flood
- Smurf Attack
- The Ping of Death
- UDP Flood
- ICMP Flood
- DHCP Starvation
- HTTP Post DoS
- PDoS
- Distributed Reflection Denial of Service

---

#### Denial of Service Attack

- Based on the premise that all computers have operational **limitations**
- Utilizes the **ping utility** to execute the attack
- You can use the /h or /? Switch with ping to find out what options are available

---

#### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack

- Variation of a Denial of Service
- Launched from **multiple clients**
- Example: DynDNS attack was done by controlling thousands of IOT devices
- More difficult to track due to the use of **zombie machines**
- What is a zombie machine?

---

#### SYN Flood

- Takes advantage of the **TCP handshake process**
- Can be addressed in the following manners:
  - Micro Blocks
  - Bandwidth Throttling
  - SYN Cookies
  - RST Cookies
  - Stack Tweaking

---

#### Smurf Attack

- Very popular attack
- Utilizes the **ICMP packet** to execute the attack

---

#### Ping of Death (PoD)

- Attacks machines that **cannot handle oversized packets**
- Ensure that systems are patched and up to date
- Most current operating systems automatically **drop** oversized packets

---

#### UDP Flood and IMCP Flood

- `UDP Flood`
  - Variation to the `PoD` that targets **open ports**
  - Faster due to no acknowledgments required
  - Sends packets to **random ports**
  - If enough are sent, the target computer shuts down
- `ICMP Flood`
  - Another name for the ping flood

---

#### Other Denial-of-Service Attacks

- `HTTP Post DoS`
  - Hangs server with slowly delivered HTTP post message
- `Permanent DoS (PDoS)` (a.k.a. `phlashing`)
- Damages the system badly
- Often attacks **device firmware**

---

#### Distributed Reflection DoS (DRDoS)

- Uses **routers** to execute the DoS attack
- Routers do not have to be compromised in order to execute the attack
- Configure routers to **not forward** broadcast packets

---

#### DoS Tools

- Tools are downloadable from the Internet
- Ease of access facilitates widespread use
- Examples

  - Low Orbit Ion Cannon
  - High Orbit Ion Cannon
  - DoSHTTP

- e.g.:
  - FakeAV
  - Flame
  - MyDoom
  - Gameover ZeuS
  - CryptoLocker and CrytoWall

---

### Defending Against DoS Attacks

- Understand how attack is perpetrated
- Configure firewall to **disallow incoming protocols** or all traffic
  - This may not be a practical solution
- **Disable forwarding** of directed IP **broadcast** packets on **routers**
- Maintain **virus protection** on all clients on your network
- Maintain operating system **patches**
- Establish **policies** for **downloading** software

---

### Defending Against Buffer Overflow Attacks

- More common than DoS a few years ago
- Still a very real threat
- Designed to put **more information in the buffer** than it is meant to hold
- **Application design** can reduce this **threat**
- More difficult to execute

---

### Defending Against IP Spoofing

- Used to gain **unauthorized access** to computers
- **Source** address of packet is **changed**
- Becoming less frequent due to security
- Potential vulnerabilities with **routers**:
  - External routers connected to multiple internal networks
  - Proxy firewalls that use the **source IP address for authentication**
  - Routers that subnet internal networks
  - **Unfiltered** packets with a source IP on the local network/domain

---

### Defending Against Session Hijacking

- The hacker takes over a **TCP session**
- Most common is the “man-in-the-middle”
- Can also be done if the hacker **gains access** to the target machine
- **Encryption** is the only way to combat this type of attack

---

### Virus Attacks

- Most common threat to networks
- Propagate in two ways
  - Scanning computer for network connections
  - Reading e-mail address book and sending to all
- Examples:
  - Sobig Virus
  - Mimail and Bagle
  - Sasser

---

#### Protecting Against Viruses

- Always use **virus scanner software**
- Do n**ot open** unknown attachments
- Establish a code word with friends and colleagues
- Do not believe security alerts sent to you

---

### Trojan Horse Attacks

- Program that looks benign but has malicious intent
- They might:
  - **Download** harmful software
  - **Install** a key logger or other spyware
  - **Delete** files
  - Open a backdoor for hacker to use
