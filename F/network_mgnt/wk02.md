## Layer 2 most common protocols

### IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)

#### Access Method

- `Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)`

  - Collision: two or more stations **transmitting at the same time** on the medium
  - `CSMA/CD` prevents and control collision when they occur

- Method of **collision detection** has been put in place
  - Tell the other stations to **hold off** transmission until the problem is sorted
  - If a collision is detected, a **jamming signal** is sent to all stations connected to the medium so they won't send data for a random amount of time

---

### Ethernet frame

- There are several **types** of `Ethernet frames` but the most commonly used are the:

- Ethernet Type II

![frames_2.png](./pic/frames_2.png)

- IEEE 802.3

![frame_802](./pic/frame_802.png)

---

- Frame structure
- **Preamble**前言
  - 7 bytes sequence of 10101010
  - Used by the received to establish **bit synchronization**
- **Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)**
  - 1 byte sequence of 10101011
  - Flag indicating the **start** of a frame
- **MAC Addresses**
  - 6 bytes
  - Unique address per Network **Interface Card**
  - Frames are received by **all adapters**
  - are **dropped** if **destination** address does **not** match
- **Type (Ethernet Type II)**
  - Indicates the **upper layer protocol** used in the payload (Ex: "0x0800" for IP)
- **Length (IEEE 802.3)**

  - Indicates the **number of bytes** of data carried in the Pavload / Data

- **Data / Payload**
  - Minimum of **`64` bytes** and maximum of **1500** bytes
  - If data is < 64 bytes, padding is added
- **Frame Control Sequence**
  - Uses a CRC-32 polynomial code
  - If **error** is detected, the frame is **dropped**

---

## IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi)

### Access Method

- **Radio Frequency** is the **medium** used for `802.11` communications

- `Half Duplex` communications

  - **Only 1** station **can transmit** at a time
  - No way to know if another station is about to transmit
  - No way to know if a collision occurred

- `Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)`
  - Avoid collision making sure that the **medium is free before transmitting**
  - 3 methods are used before accessing the medium
    - **Network Allocation Vector**
    - and **Back-off timer**
    - **Clear Channel Assessment**

- Layer 2 MPDU
  - `MPDU`
    - `MAC Protocol Data Unit`
    - Layer 2 frame
    - Composed of a **header**, a **MSDU (payload)** and a **Frame Check Sequence**

---

### Type of Frames

- **Management Frames (Type = 0)**

  - Used to **manage** the Wi-Fi network (**Connections**, **disconnections**, **broadcast** ...)
  - Management MPDU does **not** carry any MSDU
  - Management frames are **not encrypted**

- **Control Frames (Type = 1)**

---

#### IPv6 Address

---

### Routing Protocols

#### Routing

- `Routing` is the process of **finding a path to transfer** an IP `datagram` from the source to the destination
- Routing is done **by routers** which uses **routing tables** to route the traffic
- Routers always route according to the **destination IP address** located in the `IP datagram`

---

#### Routing Protocols

- `Routing protocols` learn about available routes, **build routing tables** and help taking routing decision
- Routing protocols are used to help to **dynamically update routing information** among multiple routers

- 2 main types of routing protocols

  - **Interior Gateway Protocols**
    - `Interior Gateway Routing Protocols (IGRP)`
    - `Routing Information Protocol (RIP & RIP2)`
    - `Open Shortest path First (OSPF)`
    - `Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocols (EIGRP)`
  - **Exterior Gateway Protocols**
    - `Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)`
    - `Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP (MBGP)`

- `Autonomous Systems`
  - a collection of **networks** under a **common administration**
    - IGP: Intra-AS routing protocol
    - EGP: Inter-AS routing protocol

---

##### Interior Gateway Protocol

- There are multiple types of IGP
- **Distance-vector routing protocol**

  - Use of Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate the shortest path
  - Each routers populates its **routing table** until the network **converge to stable values**
  - Example:
    - `Routing Information Protocol (RIP)`,
    - `Interior Gateway Routing Protocol(IGRP)`

- **Link-state routing protocol**

  - Each router posses information about the **entire** network topology
  - Each router **independently calculate the best** next hop
  - Information about the links are **shared** among the routers
  - Example:
    - `Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)`,
    - `Intermediate system to intermediate system (IS-IS)`

- **Hybrid routing protocol**
  - **Both** features of a distance-vector and link-state routing protocols
  - Examples:
    - `Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)`

---

##### Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

- RIP uses **distance vectors (DV)** to identify the **best path** to a given destination address
- `Routing tables` gets **updated and shared** dynamically when the topology changes
  - `RIPv2` defined in RFC 2453 is used for IPv4 networks
  - `RIP-NG` defined in RFC 2080 is used for IPv6 networks

---

#### IGP - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

- `OSPF` is a **link-state** protocol - Link-state information is **shared** among the routers of a **same area**
- The SPF algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path to each node
- OSPF versions
  - `OSPF v2` defined in RFC 2328 is used for IPv4 networks
  - `OSPF v3` defined in RFC 5340 is used for IPv6 networks
- Routers are organized in **different Areas**

- Once router is **initialized**, it uses OSPF **Hello packet** to acquire neighbors- Neighbor routers send an **Hello packet back**; Hello packets also act as keep alive
- Following the **Hello process**, a **designated router** is elected
- SPF places each routers at a top of a tree and calculate the shortest path to each destination based on the link costs
- **Link State Advertisements (LSA)** are exchanged between routers to share topology updates

---

#### IGP - Enhanced / Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP/EIGRP)

- Until recently a Cisco proprietary protocol
- Fast at maintaining routing tables (when changes are made) but not as chatty as RIP. - It sends routing updates only **when network topology changes** instead of its entire routing table at regular intervals.
- Maintains multiple tables like OSPF
  - Neighbor Tables
  - Topology Tables
  - Routing Tables
- Has multiple parameters for finding the best route such as:
  - Speed
  - Reliability
  - Hop count
  - Metric
- It supports `classless interdomain routing (CIDR)` and `variable-length subnet masks (VLSM)`
- It is **less CPU** intensive.
- It supports IPX and AppleTalk. OSPF supports only IP.
- EIGRP supports unequal-cost load balancing.
- OSPF propagates network changes to all routers in an area. EIGRP has much better convergence time than OSPF/ISIS

## Internet Control Message Protocol

- The `Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)` was created at the **same time** as the `Internet Protocol (IP)`
- Why was ICMP created?
  - Since `IP` uses a **connectionless**, **unreliable** and **unacknowledged** method to deliver datagram, a protocol was needed to assist in case of problems
- What is the main responsibility of ICMP
  - Provides support to IP in the form of ICMP message allowing different type of **communication to occur between IP devices**
- ICMP is a **layer 3** protocol encapsulated in IP datagrams

---

### Message Format

- ICMP **header** is `32 bits` long (`4 bytes`)
- ICMP message is encapsulated into a IP datagram

![ICMP01](./pic/ICMP01.png)

- Each ICMP message has a **Type**
  - Defined in the **header** by a `8-bit` field
  - A separate set of type values is maintained for each ICMPv4 and ICMPv6
- Each ICMP message has a **Code**
  - Identifies the "**subtype**" of message within each IMCP message Type value
  - General **purpose** of each kind of ICMP message

---

### Echo Request/Reply Message - 8/0

![icmp_echo](./pic/icmp_echo.png)

- **Type**

---

#### Time Exceeded Message - 11

- If the `TTL` of an IP packet reaches **0**, it must be **discarded** and an Time Exceeded ICMP message is sent back to the source
- Time Exceeded Message details
  - Type is always **11**
  - There is 2 code available
    - Code 0: TTL = 0 during transit
    - Code 1: TTL = 0 during reassembly
- Data
  - Contains the **full IP header** and 64bits of the **original IP data datagram**

---

- When is ICMP used?

- The ICMP protocol is usually used to **troubleshoot IP network connectivity**

- Applications that uses ICMP
  - `Ping`
    - Uses the "Echo request" and "Echo reply" ICMP messages
  - `Traceroute`
    - Uses the "Echo request", "ICMP Time Exceeded" and "Echo reply" ICMP messages
    - Use for `Denial of Service`
  - **Ping of death or PoD**
    - Sending millions of **oversized echo** request to a host causing it to crash
  - **Smurf attack**
    - Send a lot of ICMP echo requests to the **broadcast address** and all stations will answer with ICMP echo request bringing the station down Used for Network Scan Find out if ports are opened or closed without scanning ports
  - **Man-in-the-middle attack**
  - **ICMP Redirect**
    - Send messages to various gateway to **redirect** traffic
