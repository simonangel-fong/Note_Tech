## FTP

- `FTP`
  - `File Transfer Protocol`
- Simple way to **exchange file** over a network
- Often used to exchange file over internet
  - For example:
    - a webmaster would use FTP to **upload** new content on a website
- Based on a **client/server architecture**
- Communications is over `TCP` Port `21`

### FTP Model

![ftp-model](./pic/ftp-model.png)

- Only **one transfer** can happen at once, only **one `data connection`** (originally this was true, some newer versions of applications like FileZilla, can open **multiple data connections**)
- The transfer can happen **in ether direction**
- The `data connection` does **not need to exist** all of the time

- **Two** channels are **opened**
  - **Control channel**
    - The channel is used to **setup** `data connections`
    - **Stays opened** for the **entire session**
    - Typically using `TCP` port `21`
  - **Data channel**
    - Used to **transfer** a specific file (or other operations)
    - **Only stays opened** of the duration of the file **transfer**
    - Typically using `TCP` port `20` (**Active Mode**)

---

#### Active Mode

- The **server** opens a `data connection` to the client from port `20` to a **high range of ports** on the **client** machine
  - 服务器端打开数据连接
  - 服务器端： 20， 客户端：随机端口
- All **data is passed** over this **connection**
  The server initiates the connection to the client by making a connection to a random high port on the client. This can cause issues with client firewalls, which may block the connection.

---

#### Passive Mode - `PASV`

- Because of the use of **Firewalls…**. The `Passive Mode` has to be implemented. The server **cannot** open a **random port number** back through the firewall to the client as is done in the `active mode`.
  - The `client` asks the server (using a `PASV` command) to establish a connection to a **port #** > `10000`
  - The `server` **binds this port** to the current connection
  - The `client` **opens this bound port** for the `data connection`
  - For each request the client makes, a **different port** will be used

#### Actvie vs Passive mode

|                        | Active           | Passive          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Control channel port   | `21`             | `21`             |
| Data channel initiated | by server        | by client        |
| server port            | `20`             | >`10000`         |
| Client port            | random high port | random high port |

---

### Data Transfer

- `Stream`

  - Data is sent as a **continuous stream**, relieving FTP from doing any processing.
  - **All processing** is done by `TCP` TCP 协议处理数据， FTP 不处理
  - **No** `End-of-file indicator` is needed

- `Block`

  - The file is transmitted as a series of **data blocks** preceded by 1 or more **headers**

- `Compressed`
  - Data is **compressed** using a simple **algorithm**

---

### Block Header

- `Descriptor` field
  - 8 bits
  - `EOF(End Of File)`: Last block in the file
  - `EOR(End of Record)`: Last block in the record

| Code  | Desc                                      |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `128` | End of data block is `EOR(end of record)` |
| `64`  | End of data block is `EOF(end of FILE)`   |
| `32`  | Suspected **errors** in data block        |
| `16`  | Data block is a **restart marker**        |

- `Byte Count` field

  - 16 bits
  - **Total length** of the data block in bytes

---

### Commands / Responses

- 3 different types of commands

  - **Access control** commands
    - Specify **access control identifiers**
  - **Transfer parameters** commands
    - Specify data transfer parameters
  - **FTP service** commands
    - Define the file transfer or the file system function **requested by the user**

- In these three command types, there are between 50 - 65 commands depending on the RFC version that the application you are using complies with.

  - The code retuned **indicates** the way in which the command has been **processed**

- FTP reply codes

  - a three-digit value.
  - The **first digit** is used to indicate one of `3` possible outcomes

    - `2yz`: **Success** reply
    - `4yz` or `5yz`: **Failure** reply
    - `1yz` or `3yz`: **Error** or **Incomplete** reply

    - `x3z`: **Authentication and accounting**. Replies for the **login process** and accounting procedures.
    - `x4z`: **Not defined**.
    - `x5z`: **File system**. These replies relay status codes from the server file system.
  - The **third digit** of the reply code is used to **provide additional detail** for each of the categories defined by the second digit

## SFTP

- `SFTP`

  - two SFTP acronyms:

    - `Secure File Transfer Protocol`
      - an **unsecured, lightweight version** of `File Transfer Protocol (FTP)`
      - Based on `Transmission Control Protocol`
      - port number: `115`.
      - SFTP has a set of `11` commands.
      - **not** as **accepted widely** on the Internet.
      - **features**
        - user access control
        - file transfers
        - directory listing
        - directory changing
        - file renaming
        - deleting.
      - vs `Trivial FTP (TFTP)`
        - an **intermediate complexity level** between `TFTP` and `FTP`.
      - vs `Secure Shell FTP`
        - sometimes confused
    - `Secure File Transfer protocol (SSH FTP)`
      - aka `SSH File Transfer Protocol`
      - a secure version of `File Transfer Protocol (FTP)`
      - facilitates data **access** and data **transfer** over a `Secure Shell (SSH)` data stream.
        - part of the `SSH Protocol`.

### FTP vs SFTP

- overview is the **same**
  - used to exchange file over a network/Internet
  - Based on a `client/server architecture`
  - over `TCP`
- the difference:

  - the communications are **sent through an encrypted tunnel** between the `client` and `server`, on TCP Port `22`.

- SFTP was designed by the `Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)`
  - An **extended version** of `SSH 2.0`
    - **File transfer** over SSH and use with `Transport Layer Security (TLS)`(both asymmetric and symmetric encryption) and `VPN` applications
  - Both the commands and data are encrypted in order to prevent passwords and other sensitive information from being transferred over the network.
  - SFTP **requires** that the `client` user must be **authenticated** by the `server` and the data transfer must take place over a `secure channel (SSH)`.

---

### Operations

- `SSH` uses port `22`, and `TCP` as seen here with the classic `SYN`, `SYN/ACK`, `ACK`

![sftp_op01.png](./pic/sftp_op01.png)

- `Client` and `Server` **select** to use `SSH`

![sftp_op01.png](./pic/sftp_op02.png)

- `Client` and `Server` start to **exchange keys**

![sftp_op01.png](./pic/sftp_op03.png)

- `Client` and `Server` **finish key exchange** and start **building new keys**

![sftp_op01.png](./pic/sftp_op04.png)

- `Client` and `Server` **finish** creating the **new keys**

![sftp_op01.png](./pic/sftp_op05.png)

- `Client` and `Server` exchange **encrypted packets**

![sftp_op01.png](./pic/sftp_op06.png)

- All packets from this point on are **fully encrypted**.
  - The operation is the **same** as **in regular FTP**, but everything is encrypted.

---

## `TFTP`

- `TFTP`

  - `Trivial FTP`
  - a simple protocol for transferring files
  - on top of the `UDP`
  - port number `69`
  - designed to be **small and easy to implement**
    - lacks most of the advanced features offered by more robust `file transfer protocols (FTP/SFTP)`

- TFTP **only reads and writes files** from or to a remote server.
  - It **cannot** list, delete, or rename files or directories
  - it has no provisions for user **authentication**
- Today TFTP is generally **only used** on `local area networks (LAN)`
  - TFTP supports other services like `Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)`, `(Peer exchange)PEX`, & `Boot Service Discovery Protocol (BSDP)`

---

### Operation

- The `TFTP client` then **sends** a `read request (RRQ)` or **sends** a `write request (WRQ)`
  - TFTP **splits** a file, to be transferred,** into blocks** of size **512 bytes (default)**
  - Each `TFTP DATA block` is **numbered** and carried inside separate `UDP messages`
  - The **last block** of a file is always sent with a size **lesser than** `512`.
- When the peer receives a block with size **less than 512 bytes**, it treats that block as the **last block**

- **Reliability**:

  - Each **block** is **numbered** and sent inside a separate UDP message. Since TFTP uses UDP, reliable **delivery of each block is not guaranteed** by the underlying network protocols.
    - So, `TFTP` itself takes care of reliability by **requiring the peer** to **acknowledge each successfully received block**.

- **Flow Control**:

  - `TFTP` sends data block by **block**. After sending a block, the sending end **starts a block timer**.
    - If an **acknowledgment** is received for the block from the peer **before the timer expires**, then the **next block** of the file is **sent**.
    - Otherwise, the current block is **resent** as soon as the block timer expires and the whole process **repeats** itself **till the block is successfully acknowledged**.
  - Hence, `TFTP` is basically a **stop and wait protocol** and `flow control` is achieved **by the sender sending at most one outstanding block** at any instant of time. 受控于发送方在某一时刻能发送多少未完成的块。
