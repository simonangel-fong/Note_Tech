## AWS Application Discovery Service

- `Application Discovery Service`

  - Used to **plan migration** projects by **gathering information** about on-premises data centers
  - scan servers for **Server utilization** data and **dependency mapping** that are important for migrations

- Types of migration:

  - **Agentless Discovery** (AWS `Agentless Discovery Connector`)

    - VM inventory, configuration, and performance history such as CPU, memory, and disk usage

  - **Agent-based Discovery** (AWS `Application Discovery Agent`)

    - System configuration, system performance, running processes, and details of the network connections between systems

- Resulting data can be **viewed** within `AWS Migration Hub`
