## S3

- `Object Storage (Object-based Storage)`

  - the data storage architecture that manages data **as objects**, as opposed to other storage architectures:
    - `file system`, which manages data as a files and file hierachy
    - `block storage`, which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks.

- `S3`

  - provides user with **unlimited** storage / ”**infinitely scaling**” storage

  - users don't need to think about the underlying infrastructure
  - The S3 console provides an interface for user to upload and access user's data.

- **`S3` Use cases**

  - Backup and storage
  - Disaster Recovery
  - Archive
  - Hybrid Cloud storage
  - Application hosting
  - Media hosting
  - Data lakes & big data analytics
  - Software delivery
  - Static website

- `S3 Object`

  - Ojbects contain data, like files.
  - Ojbect may consist of:

    - **Key**, FULL path of the object

      - `s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt`
      - `s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt`
      - The key is composed of **prefix** + **object name**
      - s3://my-bucket/_my_folder1/another_folder/_**my_file.txt**
      - There’s no concept of “directories” within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
      - Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (“/”)

    - **Value**, the content of the body

      - Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
      - If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”

    - **Metadata**, list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata
    - **Tags** (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
    - **Version ID** (if versioning is enabled)

- `S3 Bucket`

  - Bucket hold object.
  - Amazon S3 allows people to store **objects** (files) in **“buckets”** (directories)
  - Buckets can also have folders which in turn hold objects.
  - S3 is a **universal** namespace so bucket names must be **unique**. (across all **regions** all **accounts**)
  - Buckets are defined at the **region level**
    - S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region

- Individual object from 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes in size.

---

## Security

- **User-Based**

  - `IAM Policies` – which API calls should be allowed for **a specific user** from IAM
  - Example:
    - **User Access** to S3 -IAM permissions
    - **EC2 instance** access - Use IAM Roles

- **Resource-Based**
  - `Bucket Policies` – bucket wide rules from the S3 console - **allows cross account**
    - Example: Use Bucket Policy
      - **Cross-Account Access**
      - **Public Access**
  - `Object Access Control List (ACL)` – finer grain (can be disabled)
  - `Bucket Access Control List (ACL)` – less common (can be disabled)
- Note: an **IAM principal can access** an S3 object if
  - The user **IAM permissions ALLOW** it **OR** the resource **policy ALLOWS** it
  - **AND** there’s **no explicit DENY**
- **Encryption**:
  - encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

---

### Bucket Policies

- JSON based policies

  - Resources: buckets and objects
  - Effect: Allow / Deny
  - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
  - Principal: The **account or user** to apply the policy to

- Use `S3 bucket for policy` to:

  - Grant **public access** to the bucket
  - Force objects to be **encrypted at upload**
  - Grant access to another account (**Cross Account**)

---

### Bucket settings for Block Public Access

- These settings were created to **prevent company data leaks**
  - If you know your bucket should **never** be public, leave these on
  - Can be set at the account level

---

### Encryption

- `Server-Side Encryption`

  - Default
  - Server encrypts the file **after receiving it**

- `Client-Side Encryption`
  - Encrypts the file **Before uploading it**

---

## Static Website Hosting

- `Static Website Hosting`
  - S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on
    the Internet
- The website URL will be (depending on the region)
  - `http://bucket-name.s3-website-aws-region.amazonaws.com`
  - `http://bucket-name.s3-website.aws-region.amazonaws.com`
- If you get a `403 Forbidden error`, make sure the bucket
  policy **allows public reads**!

---

## Bucket Versioning 版本控制

- You can version your files in Amazon S3
- It is enabled **at the bucket level**
- **Same key overwrite** will change the “version”: 1, 2, 3…. 相同的文件名会覆盖
- It is best practice to version your buckets
  - Protect **against unintended deletes** (ability to restore a version)
  - **Easy roll back** to previous version
- Notes:
  - Any file that is not versioned **prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”**
  - **Suspending versioning does not delete** the previous versions

---

## Replication (CRR & SRR)

- Must **enable Versioning** in source and destination buckets
- Buckets can **be in different AWS accounts**
- Copying is **asynchronous**
- Must give proper **IAM permissions** to S3
- `Cross-Region Replication (CRR)`
- `Same-Region Replication (SRR)`
- Use cases:
  - `CRR` – compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
  - `SRR` – log aggregation, live replication between **production** and **test** accounts
- 效果: 一旦 source 更新, target 自动更新

---

## S3 Storage Classes

- `S3 Outposts` has its own storage clas.

- `Lifecycle Rules` can be used to define when S3 objects should be **transitioned** to another storage class or when objects should be deleted after some time.

### Durability and Availability

- **Durability 耐用性**:
  - High durability (99.999999999%, 11 9’s) of objects **across multiple AZ**
  - If you store 10,000,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a **loss of a single object** once every 10,000 years
  - **Same for all storage classes**
- **Availability**:

  - Measures how readily available a service is
  - Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability = **not available** 53 minutes a year
  - **Varies depending on storage class**

- AWS offers a range of S3 storage classes that trade **Retrieval Time**, **Accessibility**, and **Durability** for Cheaper Storage.

### Standard – General Purpose

- 99.99% Availability
- default
- Used for **frequently accessed** data
- Low latency and high throughput
- Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
  - Replicated across at least three AZs.
- Use Cases:

  - Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution…

---

### Infrequent Access

- For data that is **less frequently accessed**, but requires **rapid access** when needed
- **Lower cost** than S3 Standard

#### Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

- 99.9% Availability
- Use cases: Disaster **Recovery, backups**

#### One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

- High durability (99.999999999%) in a **single AZ**;
- **data lost when AZ is destroyed**
- 99.5% Availability
- Use Cases:

  - Storing **secondary backup copies** of on-premise data, or data you can recreate

---

### Glacier Storage Classes

- Low-cost object storage meant for **archiving / backup**
- Pricing:
  - price for **storage** + object **retrieval cost**

#### Glacier Instant Retrieval

- Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed **once a quarter**三个月
- **Minimum storage** duration of **90 days**

#### Glacier Flexible Retrieval

- Types – free
  - Expedited (1 to 5 minutes),
  - Standard (3 to 5 hours),
  - Bulk (5 to 12 hours)
- Minimum storage duration of **90 days**

#### Glacier Deep Archive – for long term storage

- Types
  - Standard (12 hours),
  - Bulk (48 hours)
- Minimum storage duration of **180 days**
- the **most cost-effective** for archiving data with **no retrieval time requirement**
---

### Intelligent-Tiering

- Small **monthly** monitoring and **auto-tiering fee**
- Moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage
- There are **no retrieval charges** in S3 Intelligent-Tiering

- Tiers
  - Frequent Access tier (automatic): default tier
  - Infrequent Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 30 days
  - Archive Instant Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 90 days
  - Archive Access tier (optional): configurable from 90 days to 700+ days
  - Deep Archive Access tier (optional): config. from 180 days to 700+ days

## Other Storage

### AWS Snow Family - Edge Location

- `AWS Snow Family`

  - **storage and compute devices** used to physically move data in or out the cloud when moving data over the internet or private connection it to slow, difficult, or costly.
  - Data is **delivered to S3**
  - Highly-secure, portable **devices** to collect and process data **at the edge**, and **migrate data** into and out of AWS

- AWS Snow Family: **offline devices** to perform data migrations
  - If it takes **more than a week** to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!

#### Data migration

- `Snowcone`

  - two sizes:
    - 8TB of Storage (HHD)
    - 14TB of Storage (SSD)

- `Snowball Edge`

  - generally two types:
    - Storage Optimized, 80TB
    - Compute Optimized, 39.5TB
    - it's recommended to use a fleet of Snowballs to move **less than 10PBs** of data.

- `Snowmobile`

  - 100PB of storage
  - exabytes 艾字节 1 EB=1,000 PBs=1,000,000 TBs

#### Edge computing

- Snowcone & Snowcone SSD
  - wired or wireless access
  - USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery
- Snowball Edge – Compute Optimized
  - useful for video processing or machine learning
- Snowball Edge – Storage Optimized
  - Object storage clustering available

---

#### AWS OpsHub - software

- to manage your Snow Family Device

---

### Storage Gateway

#### hybrid cloud

- Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
- Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
- This can be due to

  - Long cloud **migrations**
  - **Security** requirements
  - **Compliance** requirements
  - IT **strategy**

- Use AWS Storage Gateway to expose the S3 data on-premise

![Storage_Cloud_Native](./pic/Storage_Cloud_Native.png)
