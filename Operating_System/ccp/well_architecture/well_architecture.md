## Well-Architectured Framework

- `AWS Well-Architectured Framework`

  - a Whitepaper created by AWS to help customers build using best-practices defined by AWS.

- Website: https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/

- The framework is divided into 5 sections, called pillars.
  - the sections address different aspects or 'lenses' that can be applied to a cloud workload.

- `General Definition`
  - `Component`: Code, Configuration, and AWS Resource against a requirement.
  - `Workload`: A set of components that work together to deliver business value.
  - `Milestones`: Key changes of architecture through product life cycle.
  - `Architecture`: How components work together in a workload.
  - `Technology Portfolio`: A collection of workloads required for the business to operate.

### On Architecture

- The AWS Well-Architectured Framework is designed around a different kind of team structure.
  - Enterprises generally have centralized teams with specific roles where AWS has distrubted teams with flexible roles.
  - Distributed teams can come with new risks, AWS mitigates these with Practices, Mechanisms, and Leadership Principles.
