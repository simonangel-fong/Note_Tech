## SSH Protocol

- `SSH (Secure Shell)`

  - a **cryptographic network protocol** that allows secure remote login and other secure network services over an unsecured network.
  - widely used in Linux to manage servers, transfer files, and perform administrative tasks.
  - Port number: 22

---

## `openssh` Package

- `openssh`

  - a package that provides tools for secure remote login, remote command execution, and secure file transfer over a network using the `SSH (Secure Shell)` protocol.

- **Key Features**

  - **Encrypted Communication**:
    - Ensures data **integrity** and **confidentiality** during communication.
  - **Authentication Methods**:
    - Supports password-based, key-based, and other authentication mechanisms.
  - **Port Forwarding**:
    - Enables secure tunneling of network services.
  - **File Transfer**:
    - Includes tools like `scp` and `sftp` for secure file transfers.
  - **Remote Command Execution**:
    - Allows running commands on a remote machine without logging in interactively.

- **Document Ref**:

  - https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/openssh/openssh-AboutOpenSSH.html#about-openssh

### Components

- `SSH Server (sshd)`:
  - The **server daemon** that **listens** for incoming SSH connections.
  - Configuration file: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
- `SSH Client (ssh)`:
  - The **command-line client** used to **initiate** SSH connections to remote servers.
  - Configuration file: `~/.ssh/config`.
- **Secure File Transfer Tools**:
  - `scp`: `Secure Copy Protocol` for transferring files between systems.
  - `sftp`: `Secure File Transfer Protocol`, an interactive file transfer **client**.
- **Key Management Tools**:
  - `ssh-keygen`: **Generates** SSH **key pairs** for authentication.
  - `ssh-copy-id`: **Copies** `public keys` to a remote host for `key-based authentication`.
  - `ssh-agent`: A **key management agent** for managing `private keys` during a session.
  - `ssh-add`: **Adds** private keys to the `ssh-agent`.
  - `sshd-keygen`: **Generates** host keys for the SSH **server**.
  - `ssh-keyscan`: **Gathers** `public keys` from remote hosts.

  - client-side settings: `ssh_config`

- To configure ssh:
  - 1. Login as `root`
  - 2. edit the configuration file in remote server `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
  - 3. Restart `sshd` service: `systemctl restart sshd`

- Best practice

```conf
# Set PermitRootLogin to no to prohibit root from logging in with SSH. Then, elevate a user's privileges after logging in.
PermitRootLogin no

PasswordAuthentication no
```

---

### Idle Timeout Interval

- To avoid having an unattented SSH session
  - Once the interval has passed, the idle user will be automatically logged out.
- Login as `root`
- configuration file in remote server `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
  - Restart `sshd` service: `systemctl restart sshd`

```conf
# sets the timeout interval for an SSH session
# 600 secs = 10 min
ClientAliveInterval 600
# the number of client alive messages that can be sent before the client disconnects and the session is terminated
ClientAliveCountMax 0
```

---

### Disable root login

- It disables any user to login to the system with root account.
- A secure measure to take for the first time setup.

```conf
# sets the timeout interval for an SSH session
PermitRootLogin no
```

![conf01](./pic/conf02.png)

---

### Disable Empty Passwords

- Prevent remote login from accounts with empty passwords.

```conf
PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

---

### Limit Users' SSH Access

- To limit the only users who need remote access

```conf
# AllowUsers user1 user2
```

---

### Using a Custom Port Number

- To secure the connection by using a custom port

```conf
Port 22
```

- Client access:
  - `ssh user@ip -p portNum`

---

### Access without Password (`SSH-Keys`)

- Advantage:

  - Avoid repetitive login
  - Enable automation through script

- Keys are generated at **user** level

  - common user
  - root

- Steps:
  - 1. Generate the key at Client side.
    - By default, the key is saved at the user level
      - private key: `~/.ssh/key_name`
      - public key: `~/.ssh/key_name.pub`
  - 2. Copy the key from Client to Server
    - The key is copy to the remote server
    - If the server login as the root, then the key will be placed in the `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  - 3. Login to server from client.

---

### Lab: Access with `ssh-keys`

- Architecture:

  - Client: Redhat 8
  - Server: Ubuntu22

```sh
# Generate the key
ssh-keygen
# Generating public/private rsa key pair.
# Enter file in which to save the key (/home/rheladmin/.ssh/id_rsa):
# Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
# Enter same passphrase again:
# Your identification has been saved in /home/rheladmin/.ssh/id_rsa.
# Your public key has been saved in /home/rheladmin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
# The key fingerprint is:

# copy the key
ssh-copy-id root@server_ip
# /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/rheladmin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
# /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
# /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
# root@server_ip's password:

# Number of key(s) added: 1

# Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@server_ip'"
# and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

# login without password
ssh root@server_ip
ssh root@192.168.204.156
```

---

## Lab: Install `openssh` on Redhat

- By default, openssh-server is installed out of the box.
- Install `openssh-server`

```sh
# list packages to verify installation
dnf list installed | grep ssh

# if needed to install
sudo dnf install openssh-server
```

---

- Start, Enable `sshd` Deamon

```sh
sudo systemctl start sshd   # Start the sshd service
sudo systemctl enable sshd    # configure it to start following a system reboot
```

---

- `sshd` Deamon

```sh
# start
sudo systemctl start sshd
# restart deamon after new configuration
sudo systemctl restart sshd
# status
sudo systemctl status sshd
```

---

- Firewall Configuration

- Configure the firewall to allow ssh connections.
  - allowing the port of SSH

```sh
# configure firewall settings
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
# success

# reload the firewall to enable the new settings
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

---

## Lab: Install `openssh` on Ubuntu

- Intall openssh-server

```sh
sudo apt-get -y update  # update packages
# update the local package index. It downloads package details from all set sources to refresh the package cache.
# sudo: Superuser Do,
# apt: package manager
# sudo apt: allows a root user to perform operations in the apt repository.
# sudo apt update: downloads package details from all set sources which are commonly listed in the /etc/apt/sources.list file and other files found in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory. As a result, apt package cache will be updated ensuring your system has the latest package information.
sudo apt-get -y install openssh-server  # install
```

- Check and enable ssh

```sh
sudo systemctl status ssh   # check status
sudo systemctl enable ssh --now   # enable and start the ssh service immediately
```

- Test for SSH: Connect the local host using SSH

```sh
ssh localhost   # build connection to localhost using SSH, pwd is required.
```

---

- Get the public url

```sh
curl ifconfig.me
```

- Connect to remote

```sh
ssh username@ip
```

---

## Lab: Generate Key

```sh
# on the client
# Generate RSA keys without a password (-N) and without detailed output (-q).
ssh-keygen -N "" -q

# confirm
# private key
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# copy public key to server
ssh-copy-id 192.168.128.50
# confirm the client know the host
cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# connect
ssh 192.168.128.50

# Confirm login attempt on server
tail /var/log/secure

# run server command in the client
ssh 192.168.128.50 hostname
ssh 192.168.128.50 nmcli c
```
