## AI Features

- Challenges in Traditional Observability

  - High volume of metrics, logs, and traces
  - Alert fatigue from too many noisy alerts
  - Difficult root cause analysis
  - Static thresholds miss dynamic patterns

- AI helps
  - detect anomalies in real-time
  - Correlate metrics, logs, and traces
  - Predict incidents before they occur
  - Summarize logs and generate insights

- Grafana Cloud

  - Adaptive Alert with ML models
  - Automatic anomaly detection
  - Machine learning-powered alert tuning
  - Event correlation engine

- Grafana OSS limitations

  - No built-in ML models or adaptive alerts.
  - No advanced log summarization.
  - Can extend via LLM plugin and APIs.
  - Great for DIY AI integrations(e.g., OpenAI)

- Integration with AI in Grafana OSS
  - use free AI tools, e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini.
  - Develop a Grafana Plugin to use API, and integrate with grafana.
