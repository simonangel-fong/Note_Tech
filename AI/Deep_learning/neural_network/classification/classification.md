## Classification

- `One hot encoding`:
  - a technique used to **represent categorical variables as numerical values** in a machine learning model.
- `Softmax activation function`

  - Mapping from features x to probabilities Å·
  - The outputs oi may not sum up to 1, as probabilities
  - The outputs oi could be even negative

- `Cross-entropy loss` / `log loss`

  - **measures the performance** of a `classification model` whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1.

- `Entropy`
  - **Quantifying the amount of information** contained in data

### Types of classification

- Types:

  - **hard assignments**:
    - each data point is assigned exclusively to a single cluster.
  - **soft assignments**:
    - assessing the probability that each category applies.
