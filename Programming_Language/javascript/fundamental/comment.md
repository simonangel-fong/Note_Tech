## Single Line Comments

Single line comments start with `//`.

Any text between `//` and the end of the line will **be ignored** by JavaScript (will not be executed).

---

## Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments (a comment block) start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will **be ignored** by JavaScript.

Block comments are often used for formal documentation.
