## Values

- The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
  - **Fixed values**
  - **Variable values**

**Fixed values** are called `Literals`.

**Variable values** are called `Variables`.

---

## Literals

- The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

  1. Numbers are written with or without decimals.
  2. Strings are text, written **within double or single quotes**.

---

## Variables

- In a programming language, variables are used to **store data values**.

- JavaScript uses the keywords `var`, `let` and const to declare variables.

- An **equal sign** is used to **assign values to variables**.

---

## Operators

- JavaScript uses **arithmetic operators** ( + - \* / ) to compute values.

- JavaScript uses an **assignment operator** ( = ) to assign values to variables:

---

## Expressions

- An `expression` is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
  - The **computation** is called an `evaluation`.
  - The values can be of **various types**, such as numbers and strings.

---

## Keywords

- JavaScript keywords are used to **identify actions** to be performed.

---

## Comments

- Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

- Code after double slashes `//` or between `/*` and `*/` is treated as a comment.

- Comments are ignored, and will **not be executed**.

---

## Identifiers / Names

- `Identifiers` are JavaScript names.

- `Identifiers` are used to name `variables` and `keywords`, and `functions`.

- A JavaScript name must **begin with**:
  - A letter (A-Z or a-z)
  - A dollar sign (`$`)
  - Or an underscore (`_`)
  - Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
  - Numbers are **not allowed** as the first character in names.
  - Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

---

## Case Sensitive

All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.

---

## Camel Case

```js
// Underscore
first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city;

// Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case)
FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity;

// Lower Camel Case
firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity;
```

---

## Character Set

JavaScript uses the **Unicode** character set.

Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
