## Confusion Matrix

- `confusion matrix`: a table that is used in `classification problems` to assess <u>where errors in the model were made</u>.
    - The `rows` represent the **actual classes** the outcomes should have been. 
    - The `columns` represent the **predictions** we have made. 
    - easy to see which predictions are wrong.
