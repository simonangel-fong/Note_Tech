- Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.

- Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).

- Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

- **Data Set**

  - In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.

- **Data Types**

- Three main categories:

  - **Numerical 数值**: Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories

    - **Discrete Data 非连续**: numbers that are limited to integers.
      - Example: The number of cars passing by.
    - **Continuous Data 连续数据**: numbers that are of infinite value.
      - Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item

  - **Categorical 分类数据**: Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other.

    - Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.

  - **Ordinal 有序资料**: Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other.
    - Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.
