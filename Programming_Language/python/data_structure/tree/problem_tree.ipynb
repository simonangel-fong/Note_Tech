    "Another classic solution is to keep track of the minimum and maximum values a node can take. And at each node we will check whether its value is between the min and max values it’s allowed to take. The root can take any value between negative infinity and positive infinity. At any node, its left child should be smaller than or equal than its own value, and similarly the right child should be larger than or equal to. So during recursion, we send the current value as the new max to our left child and send the min as it is without changing.

    "- At each node we’ll return a reference based on its value, which will then be assigned to its parent’s left or right child pointer, depending on whether the current node is left or right child of the parent.\n",

    "  - If current node’s value is **less than min**, then we return the reference to its right subtree, and discard the left subtree. Because if a node’s value is less than min, then **its left children are definitely less than min** since this is a binary search tree. But its right children may or may not be less than min we can’t be sure, so we return the reference to it.\n",
    "  - Since we’re performing **bottom-up post-order traversal**, its **right subtree** is already a trimmed valid binary search tree (possibly NULL), and left subtree is definitely NULL because those nodes were surely less than min and they were eliminated during the post-order traversal.\n",

So we discard the right subtree and return the reference to the already valid left subtree.\n",
